> If you sell to data security conscious customers you need CipherStash

CipherStash helps customers in the health, finance, insurance, education and legal industries as well as government:

* win and retain data-sensitive clients
* unlock data-driven insights by enabling safe data capture instead of avoidance
* smooth the transition to AI-enabled technology via secure, controled and audited data access
* meet regulatory compliance requirements

## Trusted data access

CipherStash enables trusted data access:

1. Sensitive data is _only_ ever accessible by the appropriate person at the appropriate time
2. Every sensitive data access is recorded along with who accessed it for auditing purposes

## Products

* CipherStash Protect

A JavaScript/TypeScript SDK that makes it easy to encrypt sensitive fields in your application—like names, emails, and health records—while retaining search and filtering capabilities.
Built for fine-grained, claim-based access control and identity-bound encryption.

* CipherStash Proxy

A drop-in proxy that sits between your application and your Postgres database.
It transparently encrypts and decrypts targetted sensitive data on the fly, enabling powerful encryption-in-use with minimal code changes.
Ideal for legacy systems or backend services that can't easily integrate an SDK.

* CipherStash ZeroKMS

A key management service that flips traditional KMS on its head—keys are derived only when needed, based on user identity and access policies.
ZeroKMS ensures that encryption keys are never stored and cannot be compromised at rest, enabling a truly zero-trust architecture.

ZeroKMS is designed for high-performance workloads, and benchmarks show it can be up to 14× faster than AWS KMS for frequent encryption and decryption operations.
This makes it ideal for modern applications that demand both speed and security without tradeoffs.
