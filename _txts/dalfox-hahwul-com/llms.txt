# Dalfox

> Dalfox is a fast, powerful open-source XSS scanning tool written in Go. It focuses on automation to streamline the process of detecting and verifying cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

Dalfox (where "Dal" is the Korean word for "moon" and "Fox" stands for "Finder Of XSS") is a comprehensive command-line tool designed for security professionals. It excels at finding XSS vulnerabilities through various modes including URL scanning, file-based inputs, pipeline processing, and REST API server capabilities. The tool offers advanced parameter analysis, DOM mining, and headless browser verification for thorough security testing.

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Basic command structure
dalfox [mode] [target] [flags] # e.g., dalfox url https://example.com --worker=50

# Scan a single URL
dalfox url https://example.com

# Use blind XSS with callback URL
dalfox url https://example.com -b https://your-callback-url.com

# Scan multiple URLs from a file
dalfox file urls.txt

# Process URLs from pipe
cat urls.txt | dalfox pipe

# Start as a REST API server
dalfox server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

# Start as a MCP server
dalfox server --type=mcp

# Use with custom payloads
dalfox url https://example.com --custom-payload payloads.txt

# Output in JSON format
dalfox url https://example.com --format json -o results.json
```
