Moving to Spain is exciting, but in many cases not as simple as packing your bags and booking a flight. Many expats make the same avoidable mistakes that can cause stress, delays, or even legal trouble. This guide outlines the most common mistakes and how to avoid them so you can enjoy your new life in Spain with confidence.
Key Takeaways
Always research before applying to visas - bring original and legalized documents.
Make an effort to learn Spanish or regional languages - it is necessary and makes a huge difference.
Appointments and paperwork take time in Spain, research and early preparation are a must.
Each Region and City in Spain can offer something unique - Choose your city based on lifestyle, climate, and budget.
Legal, financial and tax planning is key, Spanish rules differ from those in other countries.
To truly enjoy life in Spain, make an effort to integrate and learn how things work locally.

1. 🛂 Not Researching Your Visa and Residency Requirements
Spain has various visa types and requirements depending on your nationality and situation. One of the most common mistakes is assuming you can simply arrive and sort it out later. Failing to research or apply for the correct visa in advance can delay your move - or worse, get you denied entry. Always check the specific documentation needed for your case, such as the Non-Lucrative Visa, Digital Nomad Visa, or EU Family Member Residence Card.
Also, don't forget to bring original and legalized documents like your birth certificate, marriage license, family book, birth certificates and academic records (depending on the application requirements). These are often needed for visa validation, TIE application, or school registration and can be difficult to obtain from abroad.
2. 🗣 Assuming Everyone Speaks English
While English is spoken by many in major cities and tourist areas, daily life in Spain still relies heavily on Spanish, or even Catalan, Galician, or Basque depending on the region. Struggling to communicate at appointments, banks, or with neighbors can be frustrating. It helps to learn basic Spanish before your move, and consider enrolling in language classes soon after arriving to feel more integrated and confident - it will make your life and integration so much easier.
3. 🧾 Underestimating Bureaucracy
From getting your NIE to registering your address (empadronamiento) and setting up healthcare, Spain involves a lot of paperwork. Many processes can be done online but still require **advance appointments (citas previas)**which can be hard to get and may require long wait times. Don't assume things will work like in your home country.
Doing the proper research and preparing early can save you a ton of frustration.
4. 🌆 Choosing the Wrong City for Your Lifestyle
Spain is incredibly diverse, each city is special and unique and what works for one person may not work for another. Some regions are hot and dry, others rainy or cold. Some cities are fast-paced though expensive (like Madrid or Barcelona), while others are quieter and more affordable (like Valencia, Granada, or Lugo).
Moving to the wrong area could make your experience harder than it needs to be. Think about climate, pace of life, cost of living, language, and community before choosing your destination.
5. 🏠 Delaying Empadronamiento and Legal Registration
Empadronamiento is your official registration with the local municipality and it's required for most other processes like getting your TIE (residency) card, public healthcare, or enrolling kids in school. Some newcomers delay it because they're in temporary housing or unsure of the process, but doing it early is crucial.
Keep in mind that most public services and some utility companies or landlords require a local bank account (with a Spanish IBAN). Without it, you may face delays or rejections when setting up essential services or direct debits.
6. 💶 Not Planning Finances, Banking, and Taxes Properly
Spain has different tax laws than many other countries, and not understanding them can lead to penalties or surprise bills. You may become a tax resident sooner than expected (usually after 183 days/year), and worldwide income may need to be declared. It's important to research as this could also help you with understanding applicable deductions and special aids, and ultimately help you save a lot of money - and I mean, a lot (e.g. Beckham Law, BECAs, and many more...)!
Also, moving too much or too little from abroad can be a financial mistake - shipping full containers is costly, while leaving behind essential documents may delay critical registrations.
7. 🤝 Not Integrating Into Spanish Life
Spain has a strong social culture, and integrating with locals through language, community events, or even neighborhood WhatsApp groups, can make your life more enjoyable. Many expats can miss out on the full experience.
Many newcomers also delay learning how daily life works, including rules about driving. If you're from outside the EU, you may only be allowed to drive for 6 months before needing to exchange your license or retake a driving test. Failing to act in time can lead to fines or issues with insurance coverage, so make sure to start preparing early for the driving theoretical and practical exams.

Frequently Asked Questions
Do I need a visa to move to Spain from outside the EU?
Yes. Depending on your purpose - retirement, work, study, or remote work - you'll need a visa such as the Non-Lucrative Visa or Digital Nomad Visa. Always apply before arriving.
Is it hard to get appointments for Spanish administration procedures?
Yes, especially in bigger cities though this has been improving. Booking citas previas online early can save you a lot of time and stress.
Is Spanish banking necessary even with Revolut or Wise?
Yes. Many official forms and services require a Spanish IBAN and local account.

If you're from outside the EU, you can usually drive for 6 months with an international driving license. After that, you may need to exchange your license or take a new test depending on your home country.

It's highly recommended and often required for healthcare, schools, or applying for your TIE. Do it as early as possible, even with a temporary address.

1. Shorter Work Week in Spain 📉: 37.5-Hour Limit (Pending)
Spain is preparing to reduce the legal maximum work week from 40 hours to 37.5 hours. The proposed bill requires all companies to digital time-track in an aim to improve work–life balance across sectors. While still under parliamentary review, the law is expected to pass before the summer 2025 recess. Companies will have until December 2025 to update their employment agreements and processes.
2. Family Law Reform 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦: Extended Leave and Inclusive Recognition (Proposed)
The draft Ley de Familias would recognize diverse family types, including single-parent and LGTBI families, and extend state support. Highlights include:
20 weeks of paid maternity/paternity leave (extending from the current 16-week)
€100/month child allowance
5 days of paid care leave per year
The law is still in committee but is considered a priority by the government.
3. 100% Housing Tax for Non-EU Buyers 🏘️ (Proposed)
To remedy speculative real estate purchases in high-demand areas, this bill proposes a 100% tax surcharge on the purchase of second-hand homes by non-EU, non-resident buyers. That means doubling the standard property transfer tax (ITP). New builds are excluded. The law was introduced in May 2025 and may be debated in the autumn session.
4. Vacant Home Tax in Spain 🏚️ (Already in Force)
Under the 2023 Housing Law, local councils can charge up to 150% more on IBI (property tax) for homes left vacant for more than 2 years. This tax is already being enforced in several cities and aims to push owners to rent or sell empty properties.
5. Immigration Regularisation for Long-Term Residents 🛂 (In Progress)
A major immigration regularisation bill would allow migrants who can prove residence in Spain before 31 March 2025 to apply for a one-year residence and work permit. Eligible applicants must meet work, family unity, or vulnerability conditions. The law is based on a citizen-led initiative and is expected to be voted on by July 2025.
This law aims to protect minors online by:
Raising the minimum age for social media accounts from 14 to 16
Mandating parental control tools on all devices
Banning AI-generated deepfakes involving minors
It is backed by all major parties and may pass later in 2025.
7. Customer Service Law 📞: Real Agents Within 3 Minutes (Final Approval Stage)
This law would ensure better service standards for customers by requiring:
24-hour toll-free helplines for essential services
Connection to a real agent within 3 minutes
Complaint resolution within 30 days
It has cleared most legislative hurdles and is expected to be officially enacted by summer 2025.
8. New National Public Health Agency 🏥 (Expected Soon)
Leveraging on the learnings of the COVID-19 impacts, Spain is setting up a new independent public health agency to handle pandemic response, vaccines, and health alerts. This law is already in the final legislative stages and is expected to be approved before the summer recess.
9. Startup Law in Spain 🚀: Lower Taxes and Visa Benefits for Entrepreneurs
The Startup Law (Ley de Startups) aims to position Spain as a leading hub for innovation and digital entrepreneurship. It is already in force and aim to:
reduce corporate tax rate of 15% for up to four years
Provide faster and simplified visa and residency processes for foreign entrepreneurs and digital nomads
Offers improved conditions for stock options and investor incentives
Defines recognition of emerging tech businesses as a special legal category
This law is especially relevant to tech founders, remote-first teams, and early-stage investors seeking a business-friendly setup in Spain.
10. Spanish Citizenship Abroad 🌍: New Pathways for Those with Spanish Roots
Spain has introduced facilities for people with Spanish ancestry to apply for citizenship. The update includes:
Faster and clearer procedures for children and grandchildren of Spanish nationals born abroad
Eased rules for descendants of emigrants who lost or never held Spanish citizenship
Greater flexibility for those with historic or cultural ties to Spain
This is a significant improvement for applicants in Latin America, the Philippines, and other countries with large Spanish-descendant populations.

> Empadronamiento is the official registration of your address with the local town hall (Ayuntamiento) in Spain.

Whether you're a citizen, temporary resident, or undocumented migrant, this guide shows how to register-step by step.

Empadronamiento is the official registration of your address with the local town hall (Ayuntamiento) in Spain. Required under Article 15 of Law 7/1985, it's essential for accessing some public services, applying for residency, and proving your stay. Whether you're a citizen, temporary resident, or undocumented migrant, this guide shows how to register-step by step.
Key Takeaways
Empadronamiento is legally required for anyone living in Spain more than 183 days per year.
Registration is done at the Ayuntamiento (or Town Hall) of your actual place of residence.
Non-EU residents without long-term permits must renew their registration every 2 years (per RDL 6/2023).
You can register even without a lease by using authorization from a resident or social services assistance.
The process is free, and the 'hoja padronal' is the required form to initiate it.
Get your personalized relocation checklist, step-by-step guidance, and access to our complete immigration app.
What Is Empadronamiento and Why Is It Important?
Empadronamiento is the process of registering and being listed in the municipal register (padrón municipal) of your place of residence. It's regulated by Law 7/1985, RD 1690/1986, and clarified by the Resolution of 29 April 2020. Registration is a MUST and is also necessary for:
Applying for or renewing your TIE (Foreigner’s Identity Card)
Accessing public healthcare and education
Proving residence for arraigo, permanent residency, citizenship, or driver’s license validation
Enrolling in the municipal registry of unmarried couples
Legal Obligation to Register for Empadronamiento
Article 15 of Law 7/1985 requires all residents in Spain to register in the municipality where they reside the longest part of the year. This applies to:
Spanish nationals
EU citizens
Non-EU citizens (with or without legal status)
The padrón is purely administrative. It does not change your immigration status.
Who Can Register for Empadronamiento?
Anyone living in Spain for more than 6 months (more than 183 days to be exact) annually must register. This includes:
Citizens and legal residents
Students and temporary workers
Undocumented migrants (yes, you can and should register)
This is confirmed in official INE instructions from 2020.
What Documents Do You Need for Empadronamiento registration?
You’ll need the following:
Valid ID (passport, NIE, or TIE)
Proof of address, such as:
Rental contract with your information included
Utility (water, electricity, gas or internet) bill in your name
Property deed (for owners)
Authorization letter and ID from the main resident (if you're not the leaseholder)
Rental contract with your information included
Utility (water, electricity, gas or internet) bill in your name
Property deed (for owners)
Authorization letter and ID from the main resident (if you're not the leaseholder)
Hoja padronal (the registration form from your Ayuntamiento which you can find online on the town hall website)
How to Register: Step-by-Step
Book an appointment with your local Ayuntamiento (online or by calling 010).
Gather your documents: ID, proof of address, hoja padronal.
Attend the appointment, sign the form, and present your documents.
Request your certificado de empadronamiento or volante.
In some towns, the certificate is issued immediately. Others may send it by post or email.
What Is the Validity of the Empadronamiento and When Should You Renew?
For most people, empadronamiento does not expire unless you change your address. However, under RDL 6/2023, non-EU nationals without long-term residency must renew their registration every 2 years. If not renewed, you may be automatically removed from the municipal register without prior notice. Local authorities are required to notify affected individuals 3 months in advance.
🔄 How to Renew Empadronamiento:
Renewal methods vary by city and depend on whether your details have changed. Common options include:
Online: Available if your personal data or address hasn't changed and you have a digital certificate (Certificado Digital), electronic DNI (DNIe), or Cl@ve.
In person: You can always renew by visiting your local town hall. Appointments are usually required.
By phone: Some municipalities allow renewal or certificate requests by calling the local citizen service line (often 010).
🏙️ City Examples
💡 Always check your local Ayuntamiento’s website for updated procedures and eligibility.
What’s the Difference Between Empadronamiento and the Hoja Padronal?
Empadronamiento refers to the act of registering as a resident in Spain. The hoja padronal is the form used to apply. Once the form is submitted and approved, you’ll receive a certificate confirming your registration.
Volante vs Certificado de Empadronamiento
Volante: A basic summary for general use.
Certificado: A legally valid document used for immigration, schooling, social services, or pareja de hecho registration.
Ask for the certificado if you're using it for official procedures.
What If You’re Not on the Lease?
You can still register. Ask the leaseholder or homeowner for:
A signed authorization letter (Ayuntamiento usually provides a template)
A copy of their ID
A recent bill showing they reside there
Attending the appointment together is often helpful.
What If You Don’t Have a Fixed Address?
You're still entitled to register. In these cases:
Social services can verify that you habitually reside in the area.
They’ll issue a report and indicate a valid address (even if informal).
That address must be usable for official communications.
This is authorized under INE Resolution 29 April 2020.
What If the Landlord Refuses to Let You Register?
If you live there legally, you can register. The padrón is not a property or tax registry and doesn’t affect the owner.
If the landlord still refuses:
Explain the law and your right to register
Get help from social services or present alternative evidence (e.g. postal mail, witness declaration)
What Is the Certificate of Convivencia?
The certificado de convivencia proves that two or more people live together at the same address. It’s often required for:
Registering as a pareja de hecho (unmarried couple)
Enrolling children in school
Proving family units for social aid
Some town halls may require two non-family witnesses to confirm the cohabitation is real.
Does Empadronamiento Grant Legal Residency?
No. But it’s a crucial supporting document for many residency pathways. For example:
Proving 3 years of residence for arraigo social
Meeting requirements for citizenship
Applying for healthcare or public schooling access
It shows your continuous presence in Spain which matters for legalizing your stay.

Frequently Asked Questions
Is empadronamiento required to get a TIE card?
Yes. You need to prove your address with a certificado de empadronamiento when applying for or renewing your TIE.
Can I register without legal residency?
Yes. Your immigration status doesn't matter for registration. You can use your passport or ID, even if undocumented.
Do I need to renew my padrón?
If you're a non-EU citizen without long-term residency, yes: every 2 years. Others don't need to renew unless they move.
What’s the difference between empadronamiento and the hoja padronal?
The hoja padronal is the form you fill out to apply. Empadronamiento is the act of being officially registered.
Can I register if I live in a shared apartment?
Yes. Just get a signed authorization and ID copy from the person on the lease, and a recent bill.
Can multiple people register at the same address?
Yes, as long as each person can provide proof of residence or is authorized by someone who lives there.
Can I register with social services if I’m in a shelter or unstable housing?
Yes. Social services can issue a report that enables you to register with an informal or care address.
Does registration affect my landlord’s taxes?
No. Empadronamiento has no impact on property ownership or tax obligations.
Is there a fee to register?
No. The empadronamiento process and certificate are free of charge.
Can I still be tax-resident in another country if I’m registered in Spain?
Yes, if you spend less than 183 days per year in Spain and meet residency criteria elsewhere.

Background and Purpose of the Immigration Law Changes
Spain's previous immigration framework had not been comprehensively updated since 2011. Long processing delays, narrow eligibility for permits, and rigid rules made legal immigration burdensome. The updated regulation seeks to:
Match migration flows with real labor market demand
Improve legal certainty for migrants
Facilitate integration and social cohesion
Respond to demographic trends and an aging population
Work Visa and Residency Permit Changes in Spain 2025
Spain has simplified and expanded access to work permits by extending renewal periods and allowing more flexibility in employment type.
Why it matters: This promotes job stability and accommodates modern employment trends, such as gig work and side income.
Long-Term Residency Card Validity: 10-Year Option Introduced
The new law introduces longer renewal intervals for long-term residents over 30 years old, reducing bureaucracy for stable residents.
Why it matters: Reduces administrative burden and helps residents settle more securely.
Family Reunification Visa Changes in 2025
Family reunification rules have been significantly expanded to include more dependent and unregistered relatives.
Why it matters: Aligns with modern family structures and supports integration of transnational families.
Student Visa Changes in Spain 2025
Changes to student visas enhance academic and work opportunities for higher education students, while tightening rules for short-term language students.
Why it matters: These changes aim to prioritize long-term academic and professional integration while discouraging misuse of short-term study permits.
New Arraigo Pathways Introduced in 2025
Arraigo now includes additional legal paths for undocumented migrants based on labor, education, or prior residence history.
What is Arraigo? "Arraigo" means "rooting", a legal pathway for undocumented migrants to obtain residency based on ties to Spain (social, family, or employment).
Why it matters: Makes regularization more accessible and supports migrants' professional development.
Entry Requirements for Travelers to Spain in 2025
Spain clarified entry requirements for tourists and short-term visitors, including updated financial minimums and required documents.
Protections for Vulnerable Groups under Spain’s 2025 Immigration Reform
Spain has expanded the scope of exceptional residence authorizations for people facing social or humanitarian risks. These reforms aim to offer legal pathways and protection for individuals in vulnerable situations.
This update improves access to legal status and social protections for at-risk individuals.
Collective Hiring and the New Registry of Educational Institutions
Spain introduced two important systemic tools to modernize the labor and education-based migration frameworks.
1. Collective Hiring at Origin
Employers can now process job offers for multiple non-resident workers abroad in one application.
This benefits sectors with seasonal labor demand or talent shortages.
2. Registry of Higher Education Institutions
Student visas will only be granted for programs in certified academic institutions.
This ensures compliance with quality standards and EU Directive 2016/801.
Implementation Timeline
These reforms became effective 20 days after publication: February 25, 2024. Immigration offices, consulates, and employment authorities are currently operating under the new framework.

Frequently Asked Questions
What is the difference between LD España and RLD-UE?
LD España is valid only in Spain, while RLD-UE allows you to live and work in other EU countries. RLD-UE offers greater mobility but has stricter requirements and is more difficult to obtain.
Can I apply for long-term residency if I have gaps in my legal residence?
No. The 5-year period must be continuous. Absences from Spain should not exceed 6 months per year or 10 months total during the 5-year period.
What financial requirements must I meet?
You must demonstrate sufficient and stable financial resources. For 2025, the minimum required is approximately €2,400/month for the main applicant, plus €600/month for each dependent family member.
Can I work with a long-term residency permit?
Yes. Long-term residency permits grant full work rights in Spain, similar to Spanish nationals. With RLD-UE, you can also work in other EU countries after registering there.
How long is the long-term residency permit valid?
The permit is initially valid for 5 years and can be renewed indefinitely as long as you maintain the requirements. There's no maximum duration.
Can my spouse and children get long-term residency too?
Yes, family members who have lived with you in Spain for 5 years may also apply for long-term residency. You must prove cohabitation and family ties, and they must meet similar conditions regarding criminal records and legal stay.
How long does the application process take?
The decision typically takes between 1 and 3 months. For LD (Spain-only), if there's no response after 3–4 months, your application is considered approved by default (administrative silence). This does not apply to LD-UE.
Can I lose my long-term residency if I leave Spain?
Yes. If you hold LD (Spain-only), you may lose it if you're outside the EU for more than 12 months. For LD-UE, you can lose it if you're outside Spain for more than 6 years or outside the EU for over 12 months.
How does time as a student count toward long-term residency?
If you were in Spain on a student visa or doing non-labor internships, only 50% of that time counts toward the required 5 years. You must also have transitioned to a residency permit before applying.
Can I move to another EU country with a Spanish LD-UE permit?
Yes, but you must apply for residence in the new country under their local rules. Having an LD-UE permit gives you the right to move, but it does not grant automatic residency in another EU member state.

1. The Housing Market in Spain: An Overview
Spain’s real estate market has seen significant changes over the past decade. While property prices have steadily increased in major cities like Madrid, Barcelona, and Valencia, they remain lower than in other European capitals. Rental prices have also surged, especially in high-demand areas, making the decision to rent or buy even more crucial.
2. Renting vs. Buying in Spain: A Decision Matrix
To help expats make the best decision, use the following decision matrix based on personal and financial factors:
3. Tax Implications: Renting vs. Buying in Spain
Many expats overlook the tax impact of their housing choice. Here’s a quick comparison:
4. Legal Considerations & Tenant Rights in Spain
Spain has strong tenant protection laws, primarily governed by the Ley de Arrendamientos Urbanos (LAU) or Urban Leases Law (Law 29/1994, last updated in Royal Decree-Law 7/2019)↗. These laws regulate long-term rentals, landlord obligations, tenant rights, and eviction procedures.
Tenant Rights:

Lease Duration & Renewal (Article 9 & 10, LAU 29/1994): Leases are typically 1–5 years, depending on the type of contract. If the landlord is an individual, the minimum lease duration is 5 years (7 years if the landlord is a legal entity). If a contract is signed for a shorter period, it is automatically extended up to 5 years unless the tenant decides to leave. After 5 years, contracts renew yearly for up to 3 additional years, unless either party gives 4 months’ notice (landlord) or 2 months’ notice (tenant).Leases are typically 1–5 years.
Tenants are Not Liable for Normal Wear and Tear – Under Article 21 of the Urban Leases Law (LAU, 29/1994), tenants are not responsible for repairs due to normal use or aging of the property. Landlords must cover maintenance for structural issues, plumbing, and essential utilities.
Eviction Rules – Landlords Cannot Evict Without Legal Cause (Article 27, LAU 29/1994): Eviction without cause is illegal in Spain. A landlord can only evict tenants for: Non-payment of rent or utilities, Subletting without permission, Severe property damage, Personal use (if the owner needs the property for themselves or immediate family – must be stated in the contract). Notice period for eviction: If the tenant has paid rent on time, landlords must give at least 2 months’ notice before requesting the property back.
Security Deposit Rules (Article 36, LAU 29/1994): Landlords must return the security deposit within 30 days after the tenant moves out. The deposit is equal to one month’s rent for residential leases and two months’ rent for commercial leases. If damages occur, landlords must provide itemized proof before withholding any amount.

The deposit is equal to one month’s rent for residential leases and two months’ rent for commercial leases. If damages occur, landlords must provide itemized proof before withholding any amount.
About Rent Increases and Limits in Spain:

Standard Rule: Rent Increases Are Tied to CPI. Under Article 18 of the Urban Leases Law (LAU), rent increases for long-term leases must follow CPI unless stated otherwise in the contract. The CPI is published monthly↗ by Spain’s National Statistics Institute (INE) and reflects inflation.
Temporary Rent Caps (2023–2024): Due to inflation, Spain capped rent increases at 2% (2023) and 3% (2024), overriding CPI. This applies mainly to large landlords (10+ properties), while small landlords can still adjust rent based on CPI.
Exceptions & New Contracts: If a lease lacks a CPI clause, rent cannot be increased during the contract. New rental contracts are not subject to CPI limits, allowing landlords to set a new price. Short-term and tourist rentals (less than 1 year) are exempt from rent regulations.
Rent Controls in High-Demand Areas (Ley 12/2023): In regulated zones, large landlords cannot increase rent beyond set limits.

Mortgage Application Process: Step-by-Step Guide for Expats in Spain
Applying for a mortgage as an expat in Spain involves several straightforward steps:
Step 1: Determine Your Budget & Pre-qualification – Evaluate finances and get pre-qualified to know your maximum loan amount.
Step 2: Find Your Ideal Property – Search reputable property platforms like Idealista, Fotocasa, and Habitaclia.
Step 3: Gather Essential Documents – Prepare your NIE, passport, proof of income, credit reports, and employment details.
Step 4: Compare Mortgage Options – Check interest rates from multiple banks (typically 3–5% for expats in 2025).
Step 5: Arrange Property Valuation – Obtain an independent bank-approved valuation (tasación), costing around €300–€600.
Step 6: Submit the Final Application – Provide the selected bank with all documentation, including NIE, income verification, credit reports, and valuation results. Expect 2–4 weeks for final approval.
Step 7: Finalize the Purchase – Sign the purchase contract at the notary, pay taxes and fees (10–15% of the property price), and complete the property registration.

Housing costs vary widely across Spain, for more information on overall cost of living, you can check out our Cost Explorer↗.
6. Can You Get Residency in Spain by Buying Property? (Golden Visa & Other Residency Options)
Buying property can help secure Spanish residency in some cases:
Golden Visa (option no longer available as of 2025): Requires a €500,000+ investment. Grants residency & Schengen access with no requirement to live in Spain full-time.
Non-Lucrative Visa: Buying property may help demonstrate financial stability.
Digital Nomad Visa: No property purchase requirement, but having a long-term lease or property ownership can strengthen your application.
7. Hidden Costs & Unexpected Expenses of Buying a Property
Beyond the purchase price, homeowners must consider:
Mortgage setup fees (~1–2% of property value).
Property tax (IBI).
Homeowners Association (Comunidad) fees.
Maintenance costs (repairs, renovations, etc.).
8. How to Avoid Rental & Property Scams
Here are key warning signs and how to protect yourself:
Too-Good-To-Be-True Prices – If the rent or property price is significantly lower than the market average, it may be a scam.
Upfront Payment Requests Without Viewing and reviewing the contract – Never pay a deposit or transfer money before physically visiting the property.
Fake Listings & Identity Theft – Fraudsters often copy real listings and change contact details. Verify ownership and that a copy of the owner's ID is provided before signing any agreements.
Unclear or Nonexistent Rental Contracts – Legitimate rentals require a signed contract following Spain's rental laws. Avoid verbal agreements.
Pressure Tactics & Urgency – Scammers may rush you into making quick decisions to secure a 'limited-time deal.' Take your time to verify everything.
Unregistered or Unlicensed Agents – Always work with registered real estate agents (API-certified) and verify their credentials.
Ownership Verification – Request a Nota Simple from the Land Registry (Registro de la Propiedad) to confirm the owner and legal status of the property before purchasing.
Fake Deposit & Payment Methods – Use secure payment methods and never send money via Western Union, cryptocurrency, or untraceable transfers.

Frequently Asked Questions
Is it better to rent or buy a property in Spain?
It depends on your long-term plans and financial situation. Renting is a better option if you need flexibility or are unsure how long you'll stay. Buying is a good investment if you plan to stay long-term (5+ years) or want to build equity.
Can foreigners buy property in Spain?
Yes, there are no restrictions on foreigners buying property in Spain. Both residents and non-residents can purchase real estate, though mortgage requirements may vary.
How much deposit do I need to buy a house in Spain?
Non-residents typically need a 30–40% deposit, while residents can secure a mortgage with a 20% deposit. Additional costs such as taxes, notary fees, and legal fees can add another 10–15% to the total purchase price.
Are rental prices high in Spain?
Rental prices have increased in major cities like Madrid and Barcelona, with the average 1-bedroom apartment in the city center costing €1,300–€1,800 per month. Prices in smaller cities like Valencia or Seville are generally lower.
What are the hidden costs of buying a home in Spain?
Besides the property price, expect additional costs like property tax (IBI), mortgage setup fees, notary costs, legal fees, home insurance, and homeowners association (Comunidad) fees. Budget an extra 10–15% of the purchase price for these expenses.
Do I need an NIE number to rent or buy property in Spain?
Yes, a NIE (Número de Identificación de Extranjero) is required for both renting and buying property in Spain. It is necessary for signing contracts, paying taxes, and securing a mortgage.
Can I get a mortgage in Spain as an expat?
Yes, expats can obtain mortgages in Spain. Non-residents typically need a higher deposit (30–40%), while residents may qualify for 80% financing. Interest rates range from 3–5%, and loan terms can extend up to 30 years.
Can I rent out my property in Spain as a foreigner?
Yes, but short-term rentals (Airbnb, holiday rentals) may require a license depending on the region. Some cities, like Barcelona, have strict rental regulations. Long-term rentals (more than 12 months) generally do not require a special license.
What are the tenant rights in Spain?
Spain has strong tenant protections under the Urban Leases Law (LAU, 29/1994). Long-term leases typically last 1–5 years, and landlords cannot evict tenants without legal cause. Rent increases are tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) unless otherwise agreed in the contract.
How long does it take to buy a house in Spain?
The process usually takes 1–3 months, depending on mortgage approval and legal checks. Cash buyers may complete the purchase faster, while financed buyers need time for mortgage approval and property valuation.
Can buying a property in Spain help me get residency?
Buying property does not automatically grant residency. However, property ownership can support residency applications, such as the Non-Lucrative Visa. The Golden Visa (previously available for €500,000+ investments) is no longer an option as of 2025.
Is it cheaper to live in Spain as a homeowner or a renter?
In the short term, renting is often cheaper due to lower upfront costs. However, homeownership can be more cost-effective long-term, especially in high-demand areas where property values increase over time.
What happens if my landlord wants to sell the property I am renting?
If you have a valid rental contract, the landlord must honor the lease terms. If your contract is registered, you may have the right of first refusal to purchase the property before it is sold to a third party.
What legal protections do homebuyers have in Spain?
Spanish property law includes protections such as due diligence checks, legal property verification, and notary oversight. Hiring a real estate lawyer is recommended to ensure the property has no outstanding debts or legal issues.

Greetings & Social Life: Say 'Hola' to Everyone!
One of the first things you'll notice in Spain is how friendly people are. Whether you walk into a café, a small shop, or even a doctor's office, people will greet you with "Hola, buenas" (Hello, good day). And you're expected to respond, ignoring someone would be like stealing their tapas (aka, unacceptable).
In casual settings, a double cheek kiss (right first, then left) is the standard greeting between friends, acquaintances, and sometimes strangers.

The Importance of Family: The Backbone of Spanish Life
Forget the idea of moving out at 18 in Spain, family is EVERYTHING. You'll often see grandparents, parents, and kids all out together for a walk or a meal. It's normal for adult children to live at home into their 30s (especially with Spanish real estate prices).
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 What This Means for You as an Expat:
Don't be surprised if people ask about your family within minutes of meeting you.

Eating Like a Spaniard: Say Goodbye to Early Dinners

🕑 Lunch (La Comida) – Between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM, and it's the main meal of the day.
☕ Afternoon Snack (Merienda) – Around 6:00 PM (because dinner is still a LONG way off).
🍷 Dinner (La Cena) – Between 9:00 PM and 11:00 PM.

Festivals & Fiestas: Spain's Never-Ending Party Scene
Spain LOVES a good party, and if there's one thing you should embrace as an expat, it's the festival culture.
La Tomatina (Buñol)🍅 – The world's biggest tomato fight. Yes, it's messy. Yes, it's ridiculous. And yes, you should do it at least once.

Siesta: The (Not So) Mythical Afternoon Nap
While modern work schedules have made the siesta less common, especially in big cities, the tradition is alive and well in many parts of Spain. Typically, shops and businesses may close around 2:00 PM and reopen around 5:00 PM, allowing time for a leisurely lunch and a rest.
What This Means for You:
Plan your shopping accordingly. Don't expect to run errands in the early afternoon.

Terrazas: The Ultimate Social Hub
Spaniards love spending time outdoors, and terrazas (outdoor cafés) are where the magic happens. Whether it's summer or winter, locals gather here to chat, sip coffee, or enjoy a beer.
Be mindful of local customs. In some areas, there are debates about smoking on terrazas, so observe and follow the local etiquette.
Football: More Than Just a Game
Football (or soccer, for the Americans) ⚽ is practically a religion in Spain. Major matches, especially El Clásico (Real Madrid vs. FC Barcelona), can bring the country to a standstill.
How to Get Involved:
Choose a team (carefully). Aligning with a local team can be a great conversation starter. Join the locals at a bar during match time. The atmosphere is electric, and you'll quickly learn the local chants and expressions.
Even if you're not a football fan, knowing the basics can help you connect with locals and understand a significant aspect of Spanish culture.
Drinking Culture: More Social, Less Excess
In Spain, drinking is about socializing, not getting drunk. Spanish Drinking Staples:

Coffee Culture in Spain: More Than Just a Morning Ritual
If you're moving to Spain or even just visiting, prepare to embrace a whole new world of coffee culture. Unlike the grab-and-go culture in many other countries, coffee in Spain is a moment to be savored, preferably while sitting at a terrazza with friends, coworkers, or simply your thoughts.
☕ Most Popular Types of Coffee in Spain:

One unique aspect of Spanish coffee is that the beans are often torrefacto roasted, a technique where sugar is added during roasting. This makes the beans shinier, darker, and more bitter, giving Spanish coffee its distinct strong flavor.
It started as a way to preserve coffee beans during times of economic hardship. The added sugar creates a caramelized, slightly smoky taste.
The Lottery: A National Pastime
Spain's love affair with the lottery is most evident during El Gordo (The Fat One) 🎫, the massive Christmas lottery draw. It's a social event, with families, friends, and even entire villages buying tickets together.
Participating can be a bonding experience. Joining a lottery pool at work or with friends is common.
Tickets can be shared.
It's typical to buy a fraction of a ticket, making it more communal.
Even if you don't win, the excitement and anticipation leading up to the draw are worth it!
Eating Grapes on New Year's Eve
One of Spain's most beloved New Year's Eve traditions is eating twelve grapes at the stroke of midnight, one for each chime of the clock. Easy, right? Not quite! As the bell tolls, everyone scrambles to stuff grapes into their mouths at an alarming speed, trying not to choke while laughing hysterically.
Fun Fact: If you manage to eat all twelve grapes in time, it's believed to bring good luck for the new year! But beware: grapes with seeds add an unexpected challenge!
Puentes: The Art of Long Weekends
If there's a holiday on a Tuesday or Thursday, Spaniards will take Monday or Friday off too, creating a 'puente' (bridge) for an extra-long weekend.
Superstitions: Beware of Martes 13 (Tuesday the 13th)
Forget Friday the 13th. In Spain, it's Tuesday the 13th (Martes 13) that's considered unlucky! The belief dates back to Roman times, where Tuesday (Martes) was associated with Mars, the god of war, and bad omens.
Fun Fact: There's even a saying: "En martes, ni te cases, ni te embarques" (On a Tuesday, don't get married or set sail). So, if you're planning anything big on a Tuesday the 13th, expect some raised eyebrows!
Tapas: The Art of Snacking Like a Spaniard
In Spain, you don't just eat a meal, you snack your way through it. Tapas are small plates of food meant for sharing, and they're often enjoyed with a caña (small beer) or a glass of vermut.

Frequently Asked Questions
Why do Spaniards greet strangers with 'Hola'?
In Spain, greeting people, even strangers, is a sign of politeness and friendliness. Whether in an elevator, a shop, or a doctor's office, it's customary to say 'Hola' or 'Buenas' as a simple acknowledgment.
Why do Spaniards eat dinner so late?
Spain operates on a unique meal schedule, with lunch being the biggest meal of the day (around 2–4 PM). This pushes dinner back to 9–11 PM. Additionally, Spain's time zone is historically misaligned with the sun, making evenings feel longer.
Is siesta still a thing in Spain?
While modern work schedules have made siesta less common in cities, many businesses in smaller towns still close in the afternoon, allowing people to enjoy a relaxed lunch and a break before resuming work.
What's the difference between a café con leche and a cortado?
A café con leche is 50% coffee, 50% milk, while a cortado is an espresso with just a splash of milk, making it stronger.
Why do Spaniards eat 12 grapes on New Year's Eve?
It's a tradition believed to bring good luck for the new year. At midnight, you must eat one grape per chime of the clock, which can be tricky, especially if they have seeds!
What is a 'puente' in Spain?
A puente (bridge) is when a public holiday falls on a Tuesday or Thursday, and many people take an extra day off to create a long weekend.
Why is Tuesday the 13th considered unlucky in Spain?
Unlike Friday the 13th in many cultures, in Spain, it's Tuesday the 13th (Martes 13) that is considered unlucky due to its historical association with bad omens.
What is Spain's obsession with the lottery?
Spain's Christmas lottery, El Gordo ('The Fat One'), is a massive event where whole families, workplaces, and even entire villages buy tickets together in hopes of winning.
Why is football (soccer) such a big deal in Spain?
Football is deeply ingrained in Spanish culture, with fierce rivalries like El Clásico (Real Madrid vs. FC Barcelona). Matches bring people together, and game days feel like national holidays!
How should I tip in Spanish restaurants?
Tipping isn't as expected as in the U.S. In casual restaurants, rounding up the bill or leaving small change (5-10%) is enough. In upscale restaurants, tipping is more common but still lower than in other countries.
What are tapas, and why are they so popular in Spain?
Tapas are small plates of food meant for sharing, typically enjoyed with drinks. They are a key part of Spanish social life, allowing people to sample different dishes while socializing with friends and family.
What are the most popular tapas in Spain?
Patatas bravas, tortilla española, and jamón ibérico are among the most popular tapas. Each region has its own specialty, but these dishes are found across Spain.
Is paella a seafood dish?

What is cocido, and why is it so famous?
Cocido is a traditional Spanish stew made with chickpeas, vegetables, and a variety of meats. The most famous version, cocido madrileño, is served in three courses: broth, chickpeas & vegetables, and then the meats.
What is turrón, and when is it eaten?
Turrón is a traditional Spanish nougat made with almonds, honey, and sugar. It is most commonly eaten during Christmas but can be found year-round in specialty shops.
What is roscon de reyes, and why do Spaniards eat it?
Roscón de Reyes is a round, decorated cake eaten on January 6th (Three Kings' Day). Inside, there is a hidden figurine and a bean, whoever finds the figurine is king for the day, and whoever gets the bean must buy the next roscón!
What is the difference between churros and porras?
Churros are thin, crispy, and ridged, while porras are thicker and softer. Both are typically enjoyed with thick hot chocolate for dipping.
What is crema catalana, and how is it different from crème brûlée?
Crema catalana is a Spanish dessert similar to crème brûlée but flavored with cinnamon and lemon zest instead of vanilla.

NIE vs. TIE: They serve different purposes – The NIE (Número de Identidad de Extranjero) is an identification number, while the TIE (Tarjeta de Identidad de Extranjero) is a residence permit for non-EU citizens.
Applying for an NIE requires specific documents – A completed EX-15 form, passport, proof of financial or legal activity, and the Tasa 790 012 tax payment (€9.84), follow the steps in the article to apply.
Processing times vary – If applying in Spain, NIE processing can take 1-3 weeks, while applications via a Spanish Consulate abroad may take up to 8 weeks.
Some residency applications require an NIE beforehand – Non-Lucrative Visas, Golden Visas, and Entrepreneur Visas often require you to obtain an NIE before submitting your residency application.
While your NIE number does not expire, the physical certificate is usually valid for 3 months and should be kept safe for future use.

Alicante
One of the best cities for expats in Spain, Alicante, located on the Costa Blanca, is known for its beautiful beaches, pleasant climate, and relaxed lifestyle. The city offers affordable living costs, with reasonably priced housing and amenities. Alicante has a significant expat community, providing a supportive environment for newcomers. The city's coastal location and favorable weather make it ideal for outdoor and water activities. However, while Alicante offers a range of amenities, it lacks the extensive cultural and entertainment options found in larger cities. Additionally, the job market is primarily centered around tourism and services, which may limit opportunities in other professional sectors.
Barcelona
Barcelona, known for being one of the most popular cities for expats in Spain, is renowned for its stunning architecture, including Gaudí's masterpieces, beautiful beaches, and a cosmopolitan atmosphere. The city's Mediterranean climate offers mild winters and warm summers, ideal for outdoor activities year-round. Barcelona's strong economy, particularly in the tech and tourism sectors, provides ample employment opportunities for expats. The city's international community is well-established, offering a welcoming environment for newcomers. However, similar to Madrid, Barcelona has a high cost of living, especially in central areas. The city also attracts a large number of tourists, leading to crowded public spaces during peak seasons. Additionally, the Catalan language is prevalent, and while Spanish is widely spoken, learning Catalan can be beneficial for social integration.
Bilbao
Bilbao, located in the Basque Country, combines industrial heritage with modern urban renewal. It's one of the best cities in Spain and an excellent choice for expats seeking a more cultural and less tourist-driven Spanish experience. Known for the Guggenheim Museum and innovative cuisine, Bilbao offers a high quality of life, great public transport, and access to lush green landscapes. The job market is strong in engineering, education, and technology. While the climate is rainier than southern Spain, Bilbao's moderate temperatures appeal to those who prefer cooler conditions.
Estepona
Once overshadowed by Marbella, Estepona has emerged as a top expat destination thanks to its blend of authentic Spanish charm and modern, high-quality developments. Known as the “Garden of the Costa del Sol,” Estepona offers a stunning coastal setting, a beautifully restored historic town center, and some of the most attractive new-build properties on the coast. It appeals especially to families and retirees seeking a quieter lifestyle without sacrificing proximity to services, golf courses, and beaches. Estepona is also more affordable than Marbella yet shares the same coastal prestige and sunshine.
Granada
Nestled at the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, Granada is renowned for its historical sites, including the Alhambra, and its vibrant student population. The city offers a unique blend of cultural influences, with a rich Moorish heritage evident in its architecture and neighborhoods. Granada's cost of living is relatively low, appealing to students, retirees, and budget-conscious expats. The city's tapas culture is notable, with many establishments offering free tapas with drinks. However, Granada's job market is limited, with fewer opportunities compared to larger cities, often centered around education and tourism. Additionally, while the city's student population contributes to a lively atmosphere, it may also result in a transient community feel.
Las Palmas
As the capital of Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands, Las Palmas is a top choice for remote workers and digital nomads. With a subtropical climate, affordable cost of living, and strong expat community, the city offers a relaxed island lifestyle with urban conveniences. Las Palmas boasts excellent internet infrastructure, coworking spaces, and a welcoming culture. Beach life, mild weather year-round, and access to nature make it a paradise for those looking for balance between work and leisure.
Madrid
Definitely one of the best cities for expats, as Spain's capital and largest city, Madrid is a bustling metropolis known for its vibrant culture, rich history, and dynamic lifestyle. The city boasts world-class museums, theaters, and a lively nightlife, making it a hub for art and entertainment enthusiasts. Madrid's central location provides excellent connectivity to other parts of Spain and Europe, which is advantageous for both business and leisure travelers. The city's diverse job market offers opportunities across various sectors, attracting professionals from around the globe. However, the cost of living in Madrid is relatively high compared to other Spanish cities, with housing prices and daily expenses reflecting its status as a major European capital. Additionally, while the city is known for its vibrant atmosphere, it can be crowded and bustling, which may not appeal to those seeking a quieter lifestyle.
Málaga
Situated on the Costa del Sol, Málaga is known for its sunny weather, cultural heritage, and as a gateway to Andalusia. The city enjoys a mild Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of sunshine per year, ideal for beach lovers and outdoor enthusiasts. Málaga's cost of living is relatively affordable, with reasonable housing prices and daily expenses. The city has a growing expat community, providing a supportive network for newcomers. However, while Málaga offers employment opportunities, particularly in tourism and services, the job market can be competitive, and salaries may be lower compared to larger cities. Additionally, during peak tourist seasons, the city can become crowded, which may affect the tranquility of daily life.
Marbella
When it comes to luxury, Marbella stands in a league of its own. This iconic city on the Costa del Sol is favored by affluent expats, celebrities, and entrepreneurs who are seeking a premium lifestyle in the sun. Marbella offers a cosmopolitan atmosphere, state-of-the-art infrastructure, and unmatched access to luxury services, think international schools, private hospitals, yacht clubs, and gourmet dining. Beyond the glitz, Marbella also offers quieter suburban enclaves like Nueva Andalucía and San Pedro, where families can enjoy a safe and tranquil environment. Though property prices are higher, the return on lifestyle is significant for those who value comfort, status, and networking opportunities.
Mijas
Mijas is a charming town located in the province of Malaga, Andalusia, known for its beautiful white-washed houses, narrow cobblestone streets, and stunning views of the Mediterranean Sea. The town offers a relaxed lifestyle, with a strong sense of community and a focus on traditional Andalusian culture. Mijas is particularly popular among expats due to its affordable cost of living, beautiful weather, and proximity to the coast. The town is also known for its traditional Spanish cuisine, including tapas and local specialties, making it a great place to enjoy the local flavors of Andalusia.
Nerja
Located on the eastern tip of the Costa del Sol, Nerja captivates with its stunning cliffs, turquoise waters, and whitewashed buildings. Expats are drawn to Nerja for its laid-back lifestyle, warm community, and the perfect blend of natural beauty and cultural charm. Its Mediterranean climate and low-rise, human-scale town center create an intimate feel, especially appealing to retirees and digital nomads seeking peace without isolation. Compared to larger tourist hubs like Marbella or Málaga, Nerja remains more affordable and less commercialized, offering a slower pace of life with access to essential services, international supermarkets, and a growing number of English-speaking services.
Seville
Seville, the capital of Andalusia, is celebrated for its rich history, flamenco culture, and architectural landmarks. The city offers a warm and welcoming atmosphere, with friendly locals and a strong sense of community. Seville's cost of living is lower compared to major Spanish cities, making it an attractive option for expats seeking affordability. The city's cultural scene is vibrant, with numerous festivals, events, and traditional celebrations throughout the year. However, Seville experiences extremely hot summers, with temperatures often exceeding 40°C (104°F), which may be challenging for some individuals. Additionally, the job market is less diverse compared to cities like Madrid and Barcelona, potentially limiting employment opportunities for expats.
Valencia
Valencia, located on Spain's southeastern coast, offers a blend of modernity and tradition, with futuristic structures alongside historic sites. The city is known for its high quality of life, with accessible public transportation and a variety of leisure activities. Valencia's cost of living is more affordable compared to Madrid and Barcelona, making it an attractive option for many expats. The city's Mediterranean climate and beautiful beaches contribute to a relaxed lifestyle. However, while Valencia offers job opportunities, especially in sectors like tourism and education, the market may be more limited compared to larger cities. Additionally, while the city is generally welcoming, integrating into local social circles may require effort, particularly for non-Spanish speakers.
How to Choose the Right City for You
With so many diverse cities to choose from, deciding where to settle in Spain depends on your lifestyle, career goals, and personal preferences. Here’s a quick guide to help you match your priorities with the best expat-friendly cities:
For Digital Nomads & Remote Workers: Las Palmas, Valencia, and Málaga offer affordable living, fast internet, and coworking spaces.

Main 2025 Updates to Tax Regulations
Compensation for Physical or Psychological Damage:
Previously, compensation payments for personal injury were only tax-exempt if determined by courts or specific legal processes.
Now, compensation payments agreed upon through mediation or alternative dispute resolutions (not just court orders) are also tax-exempt, provided:
The compensation is paid by the insurance company of the responsible party.
A neutral third party oversees the agreement, and the agreement is recorded in an official document (public deed).
The exempt amount does not exceed what would be set by standard compensation guidelines for traffic accidents (baremo established by law).
Compensation for Dismissal or Termination of Employment:
Compensation received by workers dismissed or whose employment is terminated is exempt from tax if officially agreed during the administrative conciliation stage (prior to going to court).
Compensations set in the conciliation process with an official administrative service are explicitly tax-exempt.
However, compensations based purely on private agreements or contracts between the employer and employee (without official administrative or judicial conciliation) remain taxable.
Alimony Payments for Children:
Alimony payments made to children (from one parent to another or directly to children) set in a regulatory agreement (divorce agreement or similar agreements regulated by regional laws) are now explicitly recognized as tax-exempt for the recipient children.
These payments are tax-exempt if:
Approved officially by a judge, or
Formalized by a judicial administrative authority (letrado de la Administración de Justicia) or notarized (public deed by a notary).
Mandatory Declaration of Unemployment Benefits:
Starting from the 2024 tax year (declared in 2025), all individuals receiving unemployment benefits must file a tax return, even if unemployment benefits are their only source of income, regardless of the amount.
Increased Tax Rates on Savings:

Consequently, some minimum wage earners may now be required to pay IRPF.
What deductions and allowances are available under the IRPF?
The IRPF system offers various deductions and allowances based on personal and family circumstances, such as deductions for dependents, mortgage interest, charitable donations, and contributions to pension plans. These can reduce the overall tax liability.
How can I file my IRPF return in Spain?
IRPF returns can be filed online through the Agencia Tributaria's website using the Renta WEB service. Taxpayers may also file in person at tax offices or seek assistance from tax professionals.
What are the penalties for late or incorrect IRPF filings?

All initial visa authorizations are now standardized to a one-year validity, with renewals extending to four years. This reduces administrative burdens and offers stability for migrants. The validity of the job-seeking visa has also been extended from three months to one year, providing more time to secure employment in Spain.
Enhanced Residence Permit System (Arraigo)
Five new pathways to residency have been introduced under the updated arraigo system, including social, socio-labour, family, socio-educational, and 'second chance' arraigo for those who previously held residence permits but failed to renew. The required period of residence has been reduced from three years to two years, facilitating quicker access to legal status. Permit holders can immediately engage in employment or self-employment upon receiving residency. Most residence permits are now valid for one year and renewable for four years, except for family permits, which last five years.
Improved Employment Opportunities
Migrants can now work without requiring a separate work authorization for most permits. Students are permitted to work up to 30 hours per week, enhancing economic and social integration. A new seasonal work permit for specific activities has been introduced, providing greater protections and enabling collective hiring for seasonal labor.
Family Reunification
The family reunification process has been expanded by raising the age limit for dependent children to 26 years, provided they remain economically dependent. The new regulations also recognize unregistered partnerships, reinforcing family unity and supporting broader eligibility for family reunification.
Implementation Timeline
The reforms are set to take effect on May 20, 2025, six months after their official publication in the Official State Gazette.
