# YourOpinion.is

> YourOpinion.is allows anyone to create short, meaningful surveys **without** requiring signups, logins, or invasive data collection. It is designed to be simple, accessible, and privacy-respecting.

We define an open survey format that can be created and edited outside the platform. This format is optimized for external generation, including automatic generation by large language models (LLMs).

This enables a new workflow: instead of relying on built-in AI tools or manually copying and pasting each question into a survey editor, users can have LLMs generate surveys **directly in the supported format**. These surveys can then be imported into the platform with a single click.
