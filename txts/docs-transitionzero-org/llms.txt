- [Commodity (fuel) prices](https://docs.transitionzero.org/methodology/commodity-prices.md): This page discusses commodity prices, an essential data input for energy system models.
- [Demand profiles](https://docs.transitionzero.org/methodology/demand-profiles.md): What are electricity demand profiles, and how do they impact model results?
- [Demand](https://docs.transitionzero.org/methodology/demand-projections.md): This section outlines the methodology and input data used to develop demand projections within Scenario Builder.
- [Existing assets](https://docs.transitionzero.org/methodology/existing-assets.md): This page discusses how Scenario Builder uses existing asset data, an essential starting input for energy system modelling.
- [Financial inputs](https://docs.transitionzero.org/methodology/financial-inputs.md): This page discusses how financial data inputs influence a model
- [Future assets](https://docs.transitionzero.org/methodology/future-assets.md): This page describes input data for future assets, or what could be built in the future.
- [Model methodology](https://docs.transitionzero.org/methodology/model-methodology.md): This section outlines the modelling methodology behind Scenario Builder. Our goal is to make energy system modelling accessible by being transparent about the data, assumptions, and calculations we use - even for those without a technical background. This document is a key part of your learning journey. It's a living resource, updated as the platform evolves and shaped by valuable user feedback.
- [Model resolution](https://docs.transitionzero.org/methodology/model-resolution.md): This page explains how spatial (geographic) and temporal (time) resolution impacts modelling results. 
- [Policies and targets](https://docs.transitionzero.org/methodology/policies-information.md): Coming soon!
- [Renewable energy potentials](https://docs.transitionzero.org/methodology/renewable-potentials.md): What are RE potentials and how do they impact modelling results?
- [Renewable energy profiles](https://docs.transitionzero.org/methodology/renewable-profiles.md): What are RE profiles, and how do they impact modelling results?
- [Techno-economic inputs](https://docs.transitionzero.org/methodology/techno-economic-inputs.md): This page discusses the different types of tecno-economic input data used in energy system modelling
- [Get Started](https://docs.transitionzero.org/platform/get-started.md): If you have any questions, please reach out to support@transitionzero.org
- [What is Scenario Builder?](https://docs.transitionzero.org/platform/scenario-builder.md): A brief introduction to Scenario Builder, our free, no-code energy system modelling platform
