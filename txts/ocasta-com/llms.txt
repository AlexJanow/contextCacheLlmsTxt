At Ocasta, we are committed to operating ethically, sustainably, and lawfully. We expect the same high standards from our suppliers, contractors, and business partners. This Supplier Code of Conduct outlines the minimum standards we expect in the following areas: 1. Legal and Regulatory Compliance Suppliers must comply with all applicable local, national, and international laws and regulations, including those related to labour, health and safety, data protection, and anti-bribery. 2. Ethical Business Practices We expect suppliers to conduct business ethically and transparently, avoiding conflicts of interest, corruption, and unfair practices. Bribery, kickbacks, or illegal incentives are strictly prohibited. 3. Environmental Responsibility Suppliers should strive to minimise environmental impact through efficient resource use, reducing waste, and promoting sustainable practices in line with their operations. Preference is given to suppliers who align with our low-impact, cloud-based infrastructure ethos. 4. Labour and Human Rights Suppliers must uphold the human rights of workers and treat them with dignity and respect. This includes fair wages, safe working conditions, and a commitment to non-discrimination and freedom of association. Forced, child or involuntary labour is not tolerated. 5. Data Security and Privacy Suppliers must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, particularly where access to Ocasta systems or customer information is granted. 6. Continuous Improvement We encourage suppliers to maintain high standards, implement continuous improvement practices, and promptly report any concerns or breaches of this code.

Ocasta vs SharePoint SharePoint is a document storage and collaboration platform that can be configured as an Intranet - due to this flexibility, it’s easy to make mistakes, overload the content and give your workforce a poor experience. Ocasta is a mobile-first employee sales enablement platform to boost knowledge, compliance and culture in organisations. We’ve builtOcastato to tackle real-world problems our customers were experiencing. Search "It's confusing and with so much information on there it's hard to find what you're looking for. " - SharePoint User "The search function is very poor and it is hard to find documents on it. " - Another SharePoint User "Outdated UI Impossible to Search " - Yet Another SharePoint User In our personal lives, we’re used to having instant access to knowledge - and that usually starts with a web search. But in SharePoint, so many users create so much content, whenever employees search, they struggle to find what they need or find 10 versions of the same document that have been added over the years. Search is so important, in Ocasta, our employee platform, we built our knowledgebase search to be just like Google, but for your business.

- Modified: 2025-05-15
- URL: https://ocasta.com/quiz-frontline-health-score/

Free quiz to get your internal comms health score Internal communication sets the tone for how frontline teams interact, learn and adapt on the job. Without a clear communications framework, staff may struggle to stay informed or understand shifting priorities, making it harder to align everyone with strategic goals. The free quiz above helps pinpoint strengths and gaps, offering practical insights you can act on to support your frontline colleagues more effectively. Why frontline internal communications matter Frontline staff are often the main touchpoint for customers. Clear and consistent messaging ensures every interaction supports your wider organisational aims. Disjointed updates and outdated notices leave teams unsure about processes and expectations, ultimately affecting performance and customer satisfaction. A well-planned internal communications strategy helps frontline teams stay on message, maintain consistency and handle changing demands with greater confidence. Strategy planners and communications managers know that clarity at the frontline boosts overall brand integrity. When employees know what’s expected, they can deliver meaningful customer experiences and represent the company’s values. Informed staff tend to adapt more readily to new initiatives, ensuring that organisational changes roll out smoothly. Common challenges facing internal comms teams Time pressures, rotating shifts and multiple communication channels are just a few hurdles. Simply sending emails or pinning printouts in a break room no longer suffices. Frontline teams need engaging, bite-sized content delivered straight to their devices. Many communications planners grapple with ensuring each audience segment receives relevant, timely information. Without targeted approaches, employees either become overwhelmed by too many...

Gamify your learning One-off training isn’t enough to embed frontline knowledge but your staff haven’t got the time to revisit the information on a daily basis. This leads to inconsistent selling styles and low sales numbers. With Albert, the gamified learning app, your sales team can top up their knowledge when they’ve got the time and the fun learning format makes them 48% more engaged. Amplify sales numbers Getting a salesperson to sell without training them on the necessary knowledge is like driving to a destination without a map. You’re never going to reach your end goal. Make it easy and fun for your staff to learn on a daily basis with quick, interactive microlearning games. By reinforcing the sales knowledge they need to be successful, you’ll make it easy for your team to sell. Virgin Media saw an increase of 7. 4% in their knowledge rating from customers in just three months, along with a month-on-month 2. 2% average increase in sales. Easily make time for daily sales training Your sales team is too busy to learn, and no matter how much you try to enforce training, it gets ignored. You’re tired of watching the same mistakes happen, and these errors dramatically affect your sales numbers. Albert’s gamification app incorporates his wacky world of games into three short daily questions you set for your staff.

How 3INA achieved full control of their brand displays in 300 Superdrug stores Scaling store visits was now a breeze, with insights captured effortlessly and brand values always on point. 3INA is a Spanish-based makeup brand that took the beauty world by storm and made its way onto Superdrug's shelves across the entire UK. They founded their makeup brand with a clear vision in mind: to disrupt the makeup industry and cater to a new generation that embraces makeup with freshness, fearlessness, and inclusivity. With a strong mission and an unwavering commitment to their values, it’s crucial that their brand is represented clearly and correctly wherever it is available. However, this can be tricky when stocking your brand in third-party stores. The challenge Bringing their vibrant brand to the masses was thrilling, but it came with a challenge: ensuring consistent representation and brand adherence in every Superdrug store. Undeterred, they partnered with CDL Global and assembled an elite team of field auditors ready to conquer the task. From pen and paper to digital prowess The auditors charged into action with traditional pen and paper, but soon discovered the project was too big for old-school methods. Initially covering 20-30 stores over a few months, the project quickly expanded to encompass over 300 stores with monthly visits, which meant that hard copy reports, paper notes, and individual spreadsheets hindered their ability to collate data efficiently. As their success soared, they knew they needed a game-changer. Enter Ocasta – the digital store visit...

Discover how job task analysis identifies key job tasks and skills for better training programmes. Learn its relevance to L&D and how it supports business outcomes.

Job Task Analysis (JTA) is a process used to systematically identify and evaluate the tasks, skills, and competencies required for a specific job role. The goal of JTA is to break down the components of a job into specific tasks, the skills needed to complete those tasks, and the conditions under which they are performed. This analysis helps organisations create clear job descriptions, design relevant training programmes, and ensure employees have the skills needed to perform effectively. During a JTA, employers gather data through various methods such as interviews, observations, questionnaires, or workshops. This information helps determine the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) required for each job, aligning employee training and development with the actual demands of the role. Why is job task analysis relevant to L&D? Job Task Analysis is crucial for Learning & Development (L&D) because it forms the foundation for effective training programmes. By understanding the specific tasks employees perform in their roles, L&D professionals can design training initiatives that address real-world needs and skill gaps. This ensures that learning is relevant, practical, and focused on enhancing job performance. In L&D, JTA is often used to:Align training with business goals by focusing on job-specific competencies. Develop performance assessments based on actual job tasks. Identify gaps in current training programmes and make adjustments. Overall, JTA helps L&D professionals create targeted learning interventions that improve productivity, efficiency, and employee satisfaction.

- All Glossaries: L&amp;D Explained

Behavioural assessments evaluate employee behaviours such as leadership, teamwork, and communication. Learn how they support L&D strategies and improve performance.

A behavioural assessment is a method used to evaluate an individual’s actions, reactions, and interpersonal skills in various situations. In Learning & Development (L&D), behavioural assessments are commonly used to gain insights into how employees behave in the workplace, how they interact with others, and how they handle challenges or make decisions. The purpose of behavioural assessments is to help organisations better understand their employees' capabilities, personality traits, and areas for development, particularly in terms of leadership, teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. These assessments are often conducted through a combination of self-assessment questionnaires, role-playing scenarios, observations, and structured interviews. They provide valuable data for personal development plans, leadership training, and team-building initiatives by identifying strengths and areas for improvement in employee behaviour. Why is behavioural assessment relevant to L&D? Behavioural assessments are highly relevant in L&D because they provide a deeper understanding of an employee’s behavioural traits, which are critical for both individual and team performance. Unlike technical skills, which can often be learned and tested through traditional methods, behaviours such as communication, leadership, and teamwork are more difficult to measure and develop without proper evaluation. Key reasons why behavioural assessments are important in L&D include:Identifying leadership potential: By evaluating behaviours such as decision-making, emotional intelligence, and conflict resolution, organisations can identify employees who are ready for leadership roles or need further development. Improving team dynamics: Understanding the behavioural traits of employees helps L&D teams create tailored programmes to improve teamwork, collaboration, and communication within teams. Enhancing training programmes: Behavioural assessments...

Internal communications for frontline and deskless teams are at a crossroads. With Meta set to shut down Workplace by 2025, many organisations are now searching for a new home for their employee communities and comms. Microsoft’s answer — Viva Engage (formerly Yammer) — is shaping up to be the strongest contender. It promises to connect deskless workers with the wider company through conversations and communities. But launching Viva Engage to the frontline isn’t just a case of flicking a switch. These are people who aren’t sitting at desks, checking email or browsing SharePoint all day, so reaching them needs a more thoughtful, tailored approach.

For operations teams carrying out site and retail‑store inspections, the right tool can make all the difference. If you’ve been searching for an easier alternative to iAuditor, you’re in the right place.

Let's explore why Ocasta’s inspections and checklists offer a simpler, more user‑friendly, and measurably more effective SafetyCulture alternative for your audits and safety checks. The result? Managers finish inspections up to 7× faster, see 72% fewer issues, and redirect their time and focus back to customers, not paperwork. 1Faster Audits 0Performance increase in 30 days 30Fewer issues Why teams are seeking a simpler SafetyCulture alternative for inspections Retail moves fast. Store teams juggle deliveries, merchandising, customer service, loss prevention, and a hundred other tasks every day. When a retail audit app slows them down or buries important checks beneath layers of menus, it quickly becomes a burden rather than a benefit. That’s the feedback we often hear from managers using iAuditor: it’s powerful but overly complex for everyday retail needs. Even seasoned area managers complain the interface feels cluttered, the learning curve is steep, and configuring new checklists takes longer than running the inspection itself. Ocasta takes the opposite approach — remove the faff and put the essentials front and centre. Open the app, see today’s inspection, tap Start Inspection, glide through the checklist, hit Submit. Job done. Teams who once avoided audits now complete them enthusiastically because the process feels natural. Results our customers see: 7× faster audits – inspections wrapped up in a fraction of the time. 19% performance uplift within the first 30 days – stores level up fast once data flows. 72% fewer issues logged – spot and fix problems before they snowball.

Learn how to conduct effective competitor store visits to gain valuable insights into market trends, customer engagement, and operational efficiencies.

Retail store competitor checks can be a game-changer for retail teams. While competitors may already be observing your operations, flipping the script and learning from their successes and mistakes can give you a competitive edge. This isn’t about copying or stealing products — it’s about gathering insights to refine your own strategy. By structuring your visits and acting on what you learn, you can enhance customer experience, optimise operations, and stay ahead of market trends. This guide outlines a step-by-step approach to conducting competitor visits, from preparation to implementation, so you can turn observations into meaningful improvements that drive real business impact. The importance of competitor visits Market intelligence Regular competitor visits help uncover emerging industry trends, customer preferences, and potential opportunities. By keeping an eye on what’s changing, you can stay proactive rather than reactive. Observing how competitors evolve their offerings can provide invaluable insight into shifts in consumer behaviour and market dynamics, helping you stay ahead of the curve. Competitor visits also offer a chance to assess how external factors — such as economic trends, seasonal fluctuations, and industry regulations — affect your market. By monitoring how different brands respond to these challenges, you can adapt your approach and anticipate future shifts. Benchmarking Comparing your store’s performance against competitors highlights both strengths and weaknesses. Understanding where they excel (or fall short) allows you to refine your approach. By systematically analysing different competitors, you can establish benchmarks for critical areas such as pricing strategies, visual merchandising effectiveness, and customer...

Ensure your frontline teams get the right updates at the right time. Use this frontline comms checklist to improve clarity, timing, and effectiveness—boosting engagement and performance.

Frontline employees are the backbone of any business, interacting directly with customers, handling operations, and ensuring everything runs smoothly. But when critical updates don’t reach them on time, mistakes happen, productivity drops, and customer satisfaction suffers. A single missed update, whether it’s about a last-minute policy change, a product recall, or an urgent safety alert — can have major consequences. That’s why having a structured, effective communication strategy is essential. Without clear and timely updates, frontline teams may feel disconnected from leadership, struggle with decision-making, or inadvertently provide incorrect information to customers. This checklist will help you ensure your updates are clear, timely, and impactful: keeping your teams informed, engaged, and ready to act. Right message, right momentTimely updates make all the difference in keeping teams prepared and responsive. A well-timed communication can prevent mistakes, improve customer service, and boost productivity. When updates arrive too early, they are forgotten. When they arrive too late, teams don’t have time to react effectively. Are updates scheduled when they’ll have the most impact (before shifts, at peak hours, or at key decision points)? Have you assessed if the update is time-sensitive or if it should be scheduled at a more strategic moment? Are urgent messages sent immediately through the fastest channel (e. g. , push notifications, in-app messages)? Have you considered the best format for time-sensitive updates — brief, digestible, and to the point? Are you providing follow-up reminders for critical updates that need reinforcement? Have you tested different timing strategies to see...

A regional manager, like yourself, can assess performance and work out what needs to change so they can carry on improving performance. With regular check-ins, they can fine-tune each retail store to ensure it’s operating as efficiently and effectively as possible. So why do so many retail stores still lack advanced store visit procedures? Most retail organisations ask regional managers to check in on their stores regularly, but there is no set structure for them to follow when they carry out their store visits. This means many retail businesses find that store visits are ineffective because each is left to a person's style, process and opinion. Without proper structure, these store visits can be a complete waste of time. You work in retail, you’re busy, and you haven’t got a second to waste!

The first moment of truth happens when your customer walks into one of your stores or sees your product on the shelf. That first impression sets the tone for their entire experience and can determine whether they stay, browse, and buy — or leave. Store visits often focus on checklists and compliance, but what if we took a different approach? What if we used these visits to step into the customer’s shoes and experience the store as they do? How does it feel to walk in? Is the layout intuitive? Are key products easy to find? Does the overall atmosphere invite them to stay longer and explore? By shifting perspectives, we can uncover insights that traditional checklists might miss — helping us not just to meet expectations, but to exceed them and drive real customer loyalty. Getting into the customer mindset See what they see: Walk the store as if you were visiting for the first time. Is it welcoming? Is signage clear? Are products displayed in a way that encourages browsing? Hear what they hear: Is there background noise that enhances or distracts from the experience? Are staff engaging in helpful conversations, or do customers struggle to find assistance? Feel what they feel: Is the space inviting and comfortable? Does it make shopping enjoyable or frustrating? Key observations from recent store visits Customer-first layout: How well does the store guide customers naturally through their shopping journey? Are key promotions in the right places?

Discover how the "What’s In It For Me" (WIIFM) approach can transform internal communications for frontline teams.

Internal communication is often seen as a one-way street — messages pushed from head office, hoping they’ll resonate with teams on the ground. But for frontline workers, communication can sometimes feel like just another task rather than a helpful tool. That’s where the "What’s In It For Me" (WIIFM) approach comes in. By focusing on what’s relevant and beneficial to frontline employees, you can transform your internal comms from a background noise into a valuable asset. The challenges of engaging frontline teams Frontline teams face unique challenges. They often don’t sit behind desks, their schedules can be unpredictable, and they’re under constant pressure to perform in customer-facing roles. Here are some common pain points that make traditional internal communication less effective for frontline teams: Information overload Too many messages that don’t feel relevant can lead to disengagement. One-size-fits-all messaging Generic comms fail to address the specific needs or concerns of different roles or locations. Lack of accessibility Many frontline workers don’t have regular access to corporate tools like email or intranets. Limited time With busy schedules, employees may not prioritise messages that don’t immediately seem useful or impactful. What is WIIFM, and why does it work? WIIFM boils down to one simple question every employee asks, consciously or unconsciously, when they see a message: “How does this benefit me? ” By aligning communication with employees’ needs, you create a stronger connection and ensure your messages are not only read but acted upon. WIIFM works because it: Builds relevance Tailored messaging...

When recognition is timely, personal, and meaningful, it can transform your workplace culture. This blog explores how you can give impactful recognition that boosts morale, reinforces positive behaviours, and motivates your team to keep striving for success.

Recognition isn’t just a nice-to-have — it’s a crucial part of creating a positive workplace culture. When done right, it can boost morale, improve engagement, and reinforce the behaviours that drive success in your team. But not all recognition is created equal. A quick “good job” in passing won’t have the same impact as a thoughtful, well-delivered piece of feedback. So, what makes good recognition? Let’s break it down into three simple tactics. 1. Be timely and specificWhen someone does something great, don’t wait days or weeks to acknowledge it—recognition is most powerful when it’s immediate. The sooner you highlight their efforts, the stronger the connection between their actions and the positive reinforcement. And don’t just say “good work” or “well done” — be specific. Let them know exactly what they did well and why it mattered. For example: Not this: “Great job on that report. ” But this: “That report you put together was so clear and detailed. It really helped the team understand the data and make a better decision. Amazing work! ”2. Make it personalPeople want to feel seen and valued for who they are. That means using their name and recognising their unique strengths. Instead of generic praise, tailor your recognition to highlight their personal qualities and the impact of their contributions. Not this: “Thanks for your help. ” But this: “Jody, your problem-solving skills really shone through today. The way you handled that tricky customer situation was brilliant — it made a real difference to...

"Can you just…?" The phrase internal comms teams hear all too often. From boosting team morale to magically solving everyone's problems, these 'quick asks' are anything but simple.

Download Printable PDF Start your journey to smarter internal comms with a little fun! Download our free "Can You Just? " Word Search here. Not only is it a fun way to take a break, but it also highlights the daily challenges faced by internal comms teams. If you work in internal communications, learning and development, or HR, you’ve probably heard some version of “Can you just... ” more times than you can count. “Can you just plan an activity to boost morale? ” “Can you just make these slides look engaging? ” “Can you just turn all this chaos into order? ” These phrases might seem simple, but they often mask the enormous effort required to achieve what’s being asked. These “quick asks” add up, becoming a juggling act of impossible tasks and tight deadlines. But what if there was a better way? The hidden complexity of “can you just? ” Internal communications and HR teams are the unsung heroes of many organisations, tasked with everything from rallying team morale to delivering critical company updates. While these jobs are vital, they’re often executed without the right tools to simplify the process. This is where the frustration begins: Fragmented workflows mean you’re constantly switching between tools. Information overload leads to lost emails and missed messages. Lack of engagement makes it hard to get frontline teams to pay attention. It’s not just time-consuming — it’s exhausting.

Finding top frontline talent in 2025 remains a significant challenge. The retail sector, contact centres, field service teams, and healthcare providers are all competing fiercely for skilled, reliable staff. Once the perfect candidate accepts your offer, the period before their first day is more critical than ever. Whether this gap lasts a few days or several months, it can shape your new hire’s initial impressions and ultimately determine if they will step through the door or walk away before day one. Preboarding offers a chance to engage new starters, address their anxieties, and ensure they arrive feeling welcomed, knowledgeable, and ready to contribute. It also helps companies retain staff in a highly competitive job market. Many frontline industries — such as retail or customer support — have faced persistent challenges around turnover and low engagement. Without a strong preboarding process, the risk of last-minute dropouts and costly re-hiring efforts remains high. The purpose of this checklist is to provide a comprehensive blueprint for preboarding strategies in 2025. From the right communication cadence to the best types of content, tools, and training, this guide covers everything you need to keep new hires fully engaged. With practical tips, industry insights, and actionable advice, you can craft a preboarding experience that reassures your new starters and significantly improves retention. Why preboarding matters in 2025The frontline workforce of 2025 expects more from their employers.

Users with the Review Manage permission (i. e. admin access) can now reassign in progress Reviews to a new owner. This ensures that Reviews remain on track and don’t get delayed if the original reviewer is unavailable when completing a bigger Review, like a store audit. When’s it useful Reassigning Review’s works well for bigger Reviews, like store audits, that are less likely to be completed in one session. This means if the original Reviewer is unavailable, due to illness, vacation, or other unforeseen circumstances, the team can contact you to reassign the in progress Review to them. How to do it Navigate to the Analytics page on the web and locate the In Progress report in the Current Activity section. Select the Review to be reassigned and click Reassign Review in the detailed view. Search for the new owner and confirm the reassignment. The Review Manage permission is needed to use this mode. You can reassign Reviews to users within the same location or across the organisation, depending on your Roam permission.

When we come to the end of the retail work year, most of us want to shove it to the back of our memory, never to be thought about again—let alone carry out a review of the whole year.

This will help you and your team continually improve with a clear plan of action for what you need to tackle when you return to work in the new year.

- Categories: No Category

Did you know? Companies that build two-way communication are 4. 5 times more likely to have engaged employees. Engagement isn’t just about pushing out messages but listening and responding. But when you’re the only internal communicator responsible for keeping everyone connected, how do you find the time to gather, manage, and act on employee feedback? More importantly, how do you convince leadership of its value? Creating effective two-way communication may feel like an uphill battle if you’re a solo internal communicator trying to juggle it all. Are you wondering if there’s more you could do to foster a better dialogue with employees? Do you want to know how to make feedback more impactful while saving time? Then you’re in the right place. Let’s explore how you can foster two-way communication and meaningful employee feedback, even when you’re doing it all alone - and why external support might just be the boost you need. 1. Establish clear channels for employee feedback Start simple: If you’re the only person managing internal communications, clarity and accessibility are critical. Employees must know exactly where and how to give feedback and that those methods are easy to access. Here are some ideas: Set up feedback forms that are accessible from multiple platforms, like your internal portal, Slack, or email. Pulse surveys are quick and effective, letting you check in on employees without wasting too much time. Suggestion boxes (digital or physical) are simple, but if used properly, they can gather valuable insights—especially if you give...

- Categories: No Category

In a strategic move, Meta Platforms Inc. , the parent company of Facebook, announced the discontinuation of its enterprise communication tool, Workplace. This decision reflects Meta's broader strategy to focus on developing cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the metaverse, which the company envisions as key to the future of digital interactions. Key reasons for the shutdown: Shift to AI and Metaverse: Meta is investing heavily in AI and metaverse technologies, viewing them as crucial for the future of digital communication and interaction. The metaverse represents a virtual world where users can interact, work, and socialise in 3D environments, potentially revolutionising the way we connect online. Meta believes that concentrating on these technologies can lead to the next wave of innovation and redefine digital experiences (Fast Company) (Datafloq) . Resource Reallocation: Meta is reallocating resources from less critical projects like Workplace to support its ambitious goals in AI and the metaverse. This strategic shift allows the company to focus on high-impact areas, investing in technologies with significant growth potential. By discontinuing Workplace, Meta can better utilize its resources, including financial investments and talent, towards its core priorities (Verdict) . Cost Efficiency: Developing AI and metaverse platforms requires substantial investment. Meta's decision to phase out Workplace is partly driven by a need to manage costs and improve operational efficiency. By focusing on fewer, more strategically important projects, Meta aims to maximize its investment returns and streamline its product portfolio (Verdict) .

Are you looking to improve employee happiness but aren't sure how? Nando's must be doing something right in terms of employee satisfaction. They have made it onto the Glassdoor 2019 list of best places to work and their CEO was rated the top CEO of 2018. According to Glassdoor, 94% of staff at Nando's approve of their company CEO Rob Pappa. 86% of people would also recommend the company to a friend. We wanted to know the pros and cons of working at Nando's and what you could learn from them to improve your employee satisfaction levels. We've looked for the most common themes among the reviews on Glassdoor and Indeed. Here's what people had to say: Free Food This came up in the majority of the reviews. Employees mentioned how they received free food on every single shift. They also get to take home unsold food or food near its sell-by date at the end of the day. Along with the free food, employees appreciated the many perks they receive, such as parties, paid breaks, a 40% staff discount, benefits through Perkbox and a cycle to work scheme. What was interesting to note was that the employees who wrote about the perks and free food also wrote that the cons were long and stressful hours. Despite this, they usually gave Nando's a positive overall rating of 4 or 5 stars. This suggests that employees place a very high value and importance on perks and benefits that can save them...

According to Google's blog they were looking for a way to teach thousands of Googlers about team culture. They needed a solution that would make learning stick and one that would encourage employees to put their learning into action. Microlearning They decided to use microlearning having read about its effectiveness and ability to improve memory retention. Microlearning is an approach which allows you to deliver your learning content in smaller more digestible chunks. But of course, as always with Google, they had to put their own spin on the classic microlearning method. Whisper Course Their approach for microlearning was to create a 'Whisper Course. ' The theory behind this was that in order for employees to put their learning into action they needed a reminder. Not another class. They would send a series of emails (nudges) to managers to remind them of the tasks that they needed to do in order to put their team culture training into action. These nudges were like a quick whisper into a manager's ear to remind them, hence the name the 'Whisper Course'. According to Google over the course of ten weeks, managers built a better culture by trying these whisper suggestions out. What was in the emails? The emails would suggest things for managers to say which would create a better workplace culture. For example “I noticed and appreciated the way you ” That’s a really thought-provoking point that you brought up because . ” Other 'whisper' emails included information about how to...

Supporting the mental health of your employees is now more important than ever. There has been a huge shift in working environments and processes which can leave some employees feeling anxious and uncertain. Perhaps your employees now have to wear a mask to work, or they no longer come to the office because you have sold your space to adopt a more flexible way of working. Maybe your employees are anxious about being close to customers whilst the virus is still rife or they may be uncertain about the security of their job and thus money troubles may frequently enter their mind. Whatever the reason, it’s crucial that you check in on your employee’s mental health to make sure that they feel supported and understood. Our co-founder Ben discusses why Ocasta ditched the office to adopt a more flexible style of working. Having happy employees is also paramount to delivering good service to your customers and ensuring your business stays profitable. Mental health should never be overlooked and you should regularly check in with your employees. But how do you check in with them and what are the right questions to ask? Many employers struggle to evaluate the mental health of their employees because they feel awkward about asking the right questions. It is a sensitive subject and should be approached with care and compassion. We have compiled a list of 70 questions to help you assess the mental health of your employees, discover where they may be struggling and...

Are you keen to jazz up how your team gets to grips with new rules and ways of doing things? By turning these important guidelines into a fun competition, you can make sure everyone's on board and motivated. We'll explore some cool ideas, like turning learning into games, using everyday language to reinforce messages, adding fun decorations, and creating catchy sayings to help things stick in people's minds. Let's dive in and discover five simple yet effective ways to make sure everyone's up to speed and ready to go! Competition Turn your new policies or procedures into a competition to make your staff feel more competitive about ensuring they adhere to them. For example, you may have a new policy around lateness. You could keep a tally which recorded individuals who showed up late and those which were always on time, you could hand out prizes or punishments accordingly. Gamification Rather than making staff read and memorise a long word document. Get them to learn the fun way by gamifying questions about your policies or procedures. Virgin Media did this with Albert their e-learning hero built by Ocasta, his games include Whack-a-mole, Catapult Castle, Albert’s lab, and his very own Buzz Quiz Show. They saw an increase of 7. 4% in knowledge ratings from customers, along with an increase of 13% in sales in just 6 months!

In this five-minute catch-up with Alamsher, we explore his fictional dinner guests to his dream superpowers . From his favourite TV shows to his love-hate relationship with chocolate-flavoured treats . If you could have dinner with any fictional character, who would it be and why? Recently, I've been watching Doctor Who, so dining with the Doctor would be fascinating. Also, being a Marvel fan, any of the Avengers would be great. What's your go-to karaoke song when you want to impress the crowd? I've never been to karaoke, although during my university days, people would always ask me to go, but I never did. If you were an ice cream flavour, what would you be and why? My favourite flavour is vanilla, but I would end up eating myself if I went for that, so I'd go for chocolate, something I don't like. Sidenote: Alamsher doesn’t think anything should be chocolate-flavoured, and that you should only have real chocolate. So no chocolate cake or ice cream . What's the most interesting or unusual job you've ever had or heard of? I haven’t had that many jobs, before my current role, I worked as a PHP developer and had a stint in customer support. I’ve never heard of any either, maybe I don’t know enough interesting people . If you could be any animal for a day, which one would you choose and why?

Effective internal communication is the foundation for the success of any business. Yet, communication isn't just about conveying information; it's about ensuring that every frontline team member understands, engages with, and acts upon it. Many different learning styles, preferences, and communication needs exist within any workforce. Understanding your employees' learning styles, communication preferences, and personalities makes building an effective comms strategy much more manageable. One that ensures your messages resonate with your frontline teams every time. So, let’s examine the importance of accommodating different learning styles in internal communications teams. Understanding the holistic approach to internal communications Before we discuss the different ways to accommodate different learning styles in internal comms, it’s important to explain why incorporating various learning preferences in your strategy is essential. At its core, internal communication is more than just transmitting messages from point A to point B. It's about creating an entire culture of transparency, collaboration, and alignment within the organisation. It’s about looking beyond the digital methods such as emails, intranets and internal comms apps. These are all essential for effective internal comms, but also to remember the importance of human psychology and how it plays a massive role in how people ingest and retain information. Below are different examples of what affects an employee's ability to learn and communicate; Cognitive preferences affect learning Learning styles are often associated with cognitive preferences, such as how employees prefer to perceive, process, and organise information. For example, some staff members may be more visual learners, preferring...

Effective communication lies at the heart of every successful frontline team. However, for frontline teams tasked with delivering exceptional customer service and driving business growth, overreliance on emails from internal comms managers can pose significant challenges. Because let’s face it, we don’t like being bombarded with emails from our favourite brands at the best of times, let alone a barrage of emails, while trying to get our day-to-day work done. But don’t worry, you’re not alone; it happens in more businesses than you think, and that’s why we’ve written this email to help you get out of the email trap so many companies fall into. Researchers at the University of California found that too many emails can increase stress levels and make it challenging for employees to focus on what needs attention. So before we dive into tips on how to stop overreliance on emails for your internal comms strategy, let's first look at why this is such a damaging and relevant issue for so many internal comms professionals in 2024. Understanding the impact of email overload on frontline teams Frontline teams serve as the lifeblood of any customer-facing business, delivering exceptional service and driving sales. Yet, even with the relentless influx of emails, frontline employees often feel overwhelmed and disconnected. What was once a streamlined channel for urgent and critical business messages has transformed into a cluttered bulletin board, making it challenging for frontline staff to stay engaged.

During uncertain periods, policies and procedures give your staff guidance and clarity. But these are only effective if they are properly communicated. When you have a large workforce, communicating policies and procedures can be incredibly difficult. Making sure that staff are aware of them and understand them can be hard work. The outbreak of Covid-19 for example, has meant that policies and procedures are continuously having to be updated. This means that employers and HR teams need to constantly communicate new rules and regulations on a frequent basis. Below are key steps you need to carry out to make sure that your new policies and procedures are effectively communicated: How to communicate new policies and procedures 1. Discuss the update before you implement the update Don’t just publish a new policy or procedure and then tell your employees. You need to let employees know before it happens. Discuss with them why it’s important, who it will impact and why it is going to be created in the first place. You can do this in a news bulletin update, an email or a quick 5-minute meeting. Why is this important? It gives your staff a chance to understand the value of the policy or procedure and let in sink in. When people know what is to come they are better able to prepare and handle the situation. This is especially important if you are updating a policy. If you don’t make an announcement before you change it, staff could still be...

Frontline employees struggle more than anyone else to find time for learning so make it easy for them. Discover our list of the best learning management systems for frontline employees in 2024.

Choosing the right learning management system (LMS) for your employees is tough and it becomes even harder when you’re choosing it for frontline employees who don’t work at a desk. As you know, these employees are usually crushed for time, always on their feet and the majority don’t have access to a company email or even a computer for that matter. When choosing the best LMS in 2025 for these frontline employees it’s crucial that you look for ones which work well on mobile, tablet AND desktop devices, this is so anyone in the business can use the LMS no matter what their work situation is. The design needs to be simple and easy to use, yet incredibly engaging this is because your frontline employees have enough to think about without trying to figure out how to actually use your new learning management system. So where Luckily for you, we’ve compiled a list of the top learning management systems which we think are spot-on for your frontline employees. #1 Ocasta Training & Comms Platform Many learning tools for frontline workers focus on testing rather than building knowledge and understanding, creating a gap between what frontline workers think they know and their actual performance. Engage offers a microlearning approach that prioritises continuous learning and understanding over testing. It replaces lengthy, ineffective training courses with short, quiz-like sessions inspired by personal learning apps like Duolingo. This approach allows employees to embed knowledge efficiently.

- Categories: Employee Engagement

Discover our mega list of questions to help you boost morale in your workplace all year round. There are industry-related questions too including construction, telesales and hospitality.

Boosting employee morale in the workplace has never been more important, and the last few years have taught us that we need to pay attention to this more than ever before. So what questions can you ask your customer-facing sales team to ensure you fully understand what they need to feel happy, supported and positive? Why does employee morale take a nosedive? Employee morale can dip for a whole host of reasons, perhaps your team are feeling overworked, worried, undervalued or insecure. The reasons can also differ greatly depending on the industry in which you work. For example, employees who work in telesales may feel low because the pandemic has led to customers being less friendly towards them, or perhaps they feel uncomfortable about selling to customers during such a difficult time. If you work in the tech industry, your employees may have low morale because they feel isolated from their peers or perhaps they feel like they never get out of the house now that they work from home because of the pandemic. Your job as a leader As leaders, your job is to ensure employee morale is at a consistently high level throughout the whole year. In order to do this, you need to understand what boosts morale in the first place, find out what makes your employees tick and what keeps a smile on their face even when times are tough. We suggest selecting a few questions from our list below and sending out a quarterly survey....

Finding top talent for your frontline team is immensely tough, especially in 2025. Once you’ve found the perfect new hire the challenge doesn’t end there. You then face that uncertain period which sits between the time after they accept your offer and their first start day. This period of time can be a matter of days, a few weeks or even a few months. If you don’t utilise this time to preboard and fully engage with your new employee then you face various risks which can lead you to lose them. The risks of not preboarding your employees are as follows;The gap between interview and start date is too long - Your new hire loses interest in your company over the course of the days, weeks or months. They accept other job offers - If your new hire loses interest it can make them more susceptible to accept any other offers that come there way. They start believing negative thoughts - Your new hire may hear or read something online about your company which puts them off. If you are not communicating with them by preboarding them correctly then all they have is a negative image or thought left in their mind. This could result in them not showing up on their first day. They are anxious about the unknown - Your potential new employee may feel fearful about the unknown, if you are not plugging those gaps with helpful resources and support then your new hire may start looking...

According to Google 80% of their training is done through an employee to employee network called ‘g2g’ to boost employee knowledge. This stands for Googler-to-Googler. Basically, they have a programme where employees at Google volunteer to teach and train their fellow employees. According to their blog, they have over 6000 Google employees already signed up to volunteer. They say it’s so successful because it improves knowledge sharing amongst employees and it encourages employees to act more like owners of their development needs. We agree that in order for learning to be effective, employees must take control of their training needs. This is why our platform allows staff to access a digital knowledgebase (like Google for your business) whenever they need to learn at the time of need. Google’s most popular training courses are those for negotiation and leadership skills, sales training, and Python coding. However, the company stresses that this is not about saving money and resources. It’s about creating a culture of learning where employees know that learning is at the heart of everything they do. Ensuring that employee trainers are not forced to teach is also crucial. They must volunteer as this is where the passion comes from. If not, they can resent the company and the role, leading to poor training. So how can you deploy an employee-to-employee training programme in your business? Find out below: 1. You MUST create a continuous learning environment In order for peer-to-peer learning to be successful, your culture needs to emphasise...

If you run a lingerie store you’re probably wondering what the top challenges are for your industry in 2025.  With inflation rising, behaviours changing and trends emerging, there’s certainly a lot you need to know, so let’s talk about the top challenges for lingerie stores in 2025.   Download Free Guide: How To Increase Sales In Lingerie Industry #1 Inflation There’s no skirting around the fact that inflation is going to be a primary factor for most lingerie stores in 2025. Janet Mui, head of market analysis at RBC Brewin Dolphin, says, “inflation will remain well above 3% for the whole of 2025, and our current forecast is that it will not return to target until mid-2025”. So what does that mean for lingerie stores? Well, for most, it means they have to extend the burden of inflation onto their customers by raising their prices. This is because the cost of fibres and logistics that are used to make and deliver the underwear continues to rise. To cover the cost of the increase in prices charged by their suppliers, they have no other choice but to raise their prices if they want to remain in business.  How can lingerie stores overcome this challenge? You can’t stop inflation, but you can figure out how to make the situation work. Lingerie is a luxury item which means it’s not a necessity. Yes, underwear is a necessity, but if you wanted a basic bra, you could head down to a basic store and pick...

In the past 12 months, we’ve continued our mission of amplifying the performance of frontline teams while having a little fun along the way . Let’s take a look at our most significant highlights. Feature-packed updates for Ocasta Our commitment to ease of use and frontline performance improvement was showcased through a series of exciting updates to Ocasta. These features were created with one goal: supercharge know-how in your frontline teams . Let’s take a look at the main ones below: Prevent costly knowledge gaps with ‘Test Mode’ If you’re not testing your employees' knowledge, it means you have no tangible measure of how well your frontline team has grasped the training information you’re sending them. This can lead to significant learning gaps, which can be costly and, in some cases, risky. Previously, on Ocasta, you could create microlearning courses designed to train employees but not test them. Now, with the app’s new ‘Test Mode’, you can measure your team’s knowledge and quickly assess their level of capability. This is helpful to support compliance during onboarding or when you need confidence a critical process is understood. See how you can improve know-how in your frontline teams with test mode.

Because housekeeping is a labour intensive but lower paid occupation staff turnover can be incredibly high. If this is a concern for your company you are not alone. This is one of the biggest problem areas in terms of employee engagement for most large businesses. So how can you tackle such a huge issue and keep your housekeeping staff for the long haul? We discuss exactly why your staff are leaving and how to reduce staff turnover in housekeeping. Why are my housekeeping staff leaving? One of the initial challenges lies with what your housekeeping employee’s intentions were when you hired them. Were they interested in progressing in their career as a cleaner or were they using it as a stepping stone to move to another position? A lot of cleaners use the opportunity to get into a business say for example a hotel and they move to the front of house position. Whilst no one would condemn them for wanting to progress within the business it does leave another space to fill in the housekeeping department. Perhaps your housekeeping staff were just using the job to fill in some spare time before they moved onto a completely different role in a completely different company. Whatever the issue is we think it’s clear that this is more of a hiring issue. We know what you’re thinking. I don’t have enough candidates to choose from to be picky. Whilst this is true in an industry which is increasingly hard to recruit...

In June 2023, we took our incredible remote team away to Alton Towers, the action-packed theme park in Staffordshire.  We traded our laptops for rollercoasters & enjoyed some adrenaline-fueled fun.  Because our team works from home and rarely gets to see each other in person, we know how important it is to make the most of our get-togethers. So, rather than making them sit in front of a work-related presentation for hours with a few snacks and drinks to lighten the mood, we thought the time would be better spent enjoying rollercoasters and having some good old-fashioned fun.   #block-yui_3_17_2_1_1701256200943_9015 . sqs-gallery-block-grid . sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_1_1701256200943_9015 . sqs-gallery-block-grid . sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide . margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } After a day of scaring ourselves on every ride possible, we all retreated to our Woodland Lodge in Alton Tower’s Enchanted Village to prepare for dinner.   And, of course, dinner was filled with more rollercoasters, but not how you may think.  We sat below rollercoaster tracks and enjoyed having our evening meal served via a downward-spiralling rollercoaster track. Which, to be honest, was sometimes more entertaining because of the amount of accidents that happened rather than the novelty itself .  All in all, it was a great adventure away, so here's a big shoutout to everyone at Ocasta who embraced the spirit of togetherness & made our trip an absolute blast .

As a retail business, your ability to coach and guide your team plays a vital role in the success of your store. Conducting regular, in-the-moment employee performance reviews in retail is an integral part of effective business management. These reviews offer valuable insights into individual performance, strengths, and areas for improvement, ultimately leading to better team performance and overall store success. And who doesn’t want that? Download Free Employee Performance Review Template So what exactly are in-the-moment employee performance reviews? Unlike traditional performance reviews, which are done quarterly or annually and look at an employee’s performance over the course of the months. In-the-moment employee performance reviews can be done right on the shop floor. These are much more effective in driving change and engaging employees, making them feel happier, more valued and supported. Are they really that important? Don’t just take our word for it; in a survey by EmploySure, they found that a whopping 80% of employees prefer immediate feedback rather than waiting for annual performance management reviews. And Linkedin found that 80% of Gen Y employees would prefer to be recognised on the spot than in formal reviews. Why is that? Because, as humans, we remember our most recent experience the best. This means that feedback is most valuable when it occurs immediately after an action. Think of it like this. Why would you want to work all year, clueless about how you’re performing, making the same mistakes over and over again, when you could correct them immediately...

Are you still stuck in the Stone Age of handwritten audit reports and you’re considering going digital? If so, you’re probably in the market for a digital audit app that’s used by large brands and is proven to deliver the results you need. See how there's a simpler SafetyCulture alternative. In this article, we’re going to compare two of the leading audit apps on the market; Ocasta and SafetyCulture (iAuditor). But before we get into the comparison, let’s give a quick recap on why it’s so essential that you leave your manual reports in the past and go digital. Manual pen and paper audits are slow, outdated, and about as useful as a Nokia in a world of smartphones. Let us give you the scoop on why it's time to ditch those archaic reports: They’re very time-consuming Manual audit reports can be extremely lengthy, especially in bigger retail setups. Auditors must capture all information by hand, then manually upload all that data to a company portal, share it with all the relevant parties, juggling multiple email attachments, distribution lists, and who knows what else. All those hours spent collecting, documenting, uploading, and sharing could be better spent on exciting tasks that actually move your business forward. There’s a lot of potential for human error When auditors rely on pen and paper or spreadsheets, there is a higher risk of mistakes, such as incorrect data entry, missing information, or misinterpretation of findings.

Introducing Ocasta’s activity calendar Working in a customer-facing business is not for the faint-hearted. It's fast-paced, demanding and requires constant attention to customer needs and operational demands. With a flurry of activities happening throughout the day, it's easy for sales managers and customer service professionals to get caught up in the whirlwind of their tasks and responsibilities. And amidst all the hustle and bustle, staying updated on internal events can become quite a challenge. Here's why: Limited Time - customer-facing professionals often have jam-packed schedules. They are busy assisting customers, managing inventory, handling transactions, and ensuring the smooth running of the store. Varied Schedules - The nature of rotating schedules means that different employees are present at different times. This makes it difficult to disseminate information to the entire workforce effectively. Communication Channels - Traditional communication channels, such as email or paper notices, can be easily overlooked or lost amidst the daily chaos of retail operations. Retail professionals may not have the luxury of accessing their emails regularly or have a central location to check for important updates. This fragmented communication approach can lead to misunderstandings, missed opportunities, and a lack of engagement with internal events. Information Overload - There is a constant influx of information, from promotional offers to new product launches. Amidst this abundance of data, internal event announcements can get lost or overshadowed. To address these challenges, Ocasta now boasts an activity calendar due to popular demand from our customers. What does it do? It gives everyone...

Because whilst Yammer is a great tool for socialising and building a positive, engaged culture in an organisation, it can pose severe problems when using them for business-critical comms. Before we dive into how you can improve employee engagement on tools like Yammer, let’s talk about what it’s actually good for. What is Yammer good for? Yammer is like having your own private social network at work. It's all about bringing your team together, encouraging open communication, and sharing knowledge in a secure, user-friendly space. Yammer helps you stay connected with your colleagues, exchange ideas, and collaborate effectively. It's a place where frontline teams can tackle challenges, celebrate successes, and build a real sense of community. However, because it’s more of a social platform, this means it’s not entirely effective for business-critical communications. Let’s look at some of the biggest challenges below. Common issues with Yammer #1 “The worst part is the lack of a great interface for the mobile version. Especially for this app, which is not crucial, an easy to use mobile platform would increase use. ” One of the biggest downsides reported by users is the less-than-stellar interface of Yammer’s mobile version.

In today's competitive retail industry, effective communication plays a pivotal role in achieving organisational success. However, the sheer volume of information circulating within retail organisations can often lead to information overload, hampering productivity and decision-making. Optimising communication channels and adopting streamlined platforms becomes crucial to combat this challenge. Follow these quick tips to simplify information flow within your retail organisation and delve into the benefits of leveraging specialised communication tools like Engage. The burden of information overload Information overload can be detrimental to the smooth functioning of retail organisations.

This can result in miscommunication, delayed actions, and missed opportunities. Simplifying information flow is essential to ensure clarity, focus, and improved decision-making. How does information overload affect information retention? Information overload isn’t just a fancy word. It can really affect how your customer-facing teams retain information. Here’s exactly how it impacts their productivity at work.

Among the key factors that contribute to success, predictability stands out as a powerful tool. Read on to explore the significance of predictability in training and communications for customer-facing teams and how it helps build strong connections with your employees! So, let's dive in and discover the power of predictability! Building trust through consistency Consistency is key in training and communications for customer-facing teams.

However, with busy schedules and information overload, it's essential to deliver messages that are short, punchy, and to the point. In this article, we'll explore strategies that retail managers can employ to ensure their communication and training materials are concise and engaging so they can maximise employee engagement and knowledge retention. You must define clear objectives Before crafting any communication or training material, establish clear objectives. Identify the core message you want to convey or the specific skills and knowledge you want to impart. Having a clear focus will help you eliminate unnecessary information and keep your content concise. Setting clear objectives for your content is essential to avoid waffling and keep it punchy and concise. Start by defining your content's purpose and desired outcome—whether it's to inform, persuade, or educate. Next, identify your target audience and understand their specific needs and interests. With this information in mind, craft specific and measurable objectives that focus on delivering key messages effectively. Break down complex topics into bite-sized pieces and prioritise the most relevant information. Finally, regularly review and refine your objectives to ensure they align with your content's purpose and maintain a sharp and concise approach.

The internal calendar gives everyone a clear view of all upcoming events.

Your frontline employees are busy fulfilling the demands of your customers, which makes staying up to date with the latest events challenging. Sending another internal comms message for your latest business event won’t suffice because it gets lost in the sea of information, and employees forget to note what’s happening in their calendar. That’s precisely why we launched the frontline calendar in June. Now everyone has a clear view of all upcoming events, whether it's your new product launches, summer sales, social events or engagement campaigns. The internal calendar ensures that important events are never missed or overlooked again. See how the calendar can support your frontline team.

With 1 in 5 new starters not showing up, it’s vital to do everything you can to excite your new hires and give them the confidence to start with your team. What is preboarding? Preboarding is the structured process of engaging and preparing new hires between job offer acceptance and their first working day, ensuring a smooth transition into their role and reducing first-day no-shows. Key benefits of preboarding: Reduces first-day no-shows Boosts employee confidence Speeds up training and onboarding Strengthens company culture The business case for preboarding Not only does preboarding improve retention, but combining it with onboarding can also save businesses up to £3,000 per new hire.

Are you tirelessly publishing learning content for your customer-facing teams, only to find that they never put their learning into action? Are you becoming frustrated by their lack of commitment, and you aren’t sure what steps to take next? It sounds like your business is suffering from the dreaded ‘learning-doing gap’. What is the learning-doing gap? The learning-doing gap refers to the difference between what individuals know and what they actually put into practice. In other words, it’s the difference between learning something and applying it in real-life situations. This gap can occur due to various reasons, such as a lack of motivation, resources, or support, or simply a lack of understanding or skill to apply what has been learned. For example, an employee may attend a training program and learn new skills, but may not be able to implement them in their work due to a lack of support from their manager or a lack of opportunity to practise those skills. Closing the learning-doing gap requires a concerted effort to not only provide learning opportunities but also to create a supportive environment that encourages and enables the application of what has been learned. What are the possible reasons why my customer-facing teams aren’t putting their learning into practice? As mentioned above, there are a huge variety of reasons why your employees aren’t putting their learning into practice. So with that in mind, let’s discuss in more detail the things which influence the learning-doing gap and how you can overcome...

If this sounds familiar to you, it’s time to start asking the right questions so you can understand how engaged your employees really are. What is employee engagement? Employee engagement is a term used to describe how committed your employees are to their job and your organisation. An engaged employee is someone who truly cares about the performance of the company and will go above and beyond to deliver work that helps you exceed your targets. They understand how they contribute to the overall success of your business and they come to work every day with a positive, can-do attitude. An engaged employee is a step above a happy employee A happy employee will come to work with a positive attitude and genuinely loves their job and the people they work with. However, they are not quite as committed as the engaged employee. They will not put in discretionary effort to ensure a project is completed on time and they may not help others out if it means they have to work late. These employees are happy because their own needs are being met but they are not so concerned about the well-being of your business. What does it take to make your employees feel motivated and engaged? We are all human and we all have unique needs and...

Personalisation is an essential part of the customer experience and it shouldn’t be overlooked for your employees either. We now demand more than ever before and we expect services to be tailor-made to our needs. Everything from online ads, music stations, mobile apps and social algorithms are created to cater to our specific needs. This is the same for learning. Standardised learning which is created for everyone is set up to fail for three main reasons. It isn’t useful or relevant to everyoneIt doesn’t detail topics which are important to certain learnersPeople lose interest quickly when something doesn’t solve a specific problem for themPersonalised learning puts employees in control of their learning. It makes it more engaging and transforms performance more quickly and more effectively. We expect you are now wondering how you can create a more personalised learning experience?

Make it so the home screen is tailor-made to them and their preferences. A perfect example is Facebook, no ones’ homepage is the same when they launch the app. Their algorithm works by ranking all posts and how likely a user will have a positive reaction to those posts.

We all know about influencers on Instagram. These people have tons of followers who engage with them on a daily basis. They are admired which is why thousands of companies try to get their products worn or mentioned by them. Plus they have the power to persuade or change opinions. But these people don’t just exist on social media platforms they also exist within your company. They are your internal influencers. Why should I care if these influencers exist in my business? Your strategy should go beyond emails, messages, and notifications. It needs to include people who can promote and reinforce your messages face-to-face. Influencers are important employees who can have a big impact on your workforce. They are different from company ambassadors because these are usually high-performing employees. Internal influencers don’t have to have the best performance record. They just need to have strong relationships with everyone within your business and have the ability to convey your message in a friendly and conversational way. They are usually quite opinionated and are always up to date on the latest news amongst your frontline employees. Internal influencers are usually nominated by their peers, whereas ambassadors usually self-volunteer. The tricky part is actually getting the influencer on board with you. If they are disengaged then the chances of them wanting extra work are going to be slim. So how do you spot your internal influencers? #1 Spot the signs yourself – If you have a medium team you can probably see for yourself who is...

SharePoint is a document storage and collaboration platform that can be configured as an Intranet - due to this flexibility, it’s easy to make mistakes, overload the content and give you workforce a poor experience. These tips should help you avoid common pitfalls when creating or managing SharePoint as an Intranet. Plan for searchIn our personal lives, we’re used to having instant access to knowledge - and that usually starts with a web search. In businesses and organisations, content is hidden and hard to find. Make sure: Your content is structured well and longer content is broken down into multiple pages. Includes tag and keywords that people may search for - if you have a page about Closed Circuit Television, include a tag for CCTV. Don’t hide text in banners or pictures - SharePoint won’t be able to access these when searching. When adding any new pages, ask yourself what would I search for to find this, and test it out. In fact, Search is so important, in our employee platform,Ocastawe built our knowledgebase search to be just like Google, but for your business.
