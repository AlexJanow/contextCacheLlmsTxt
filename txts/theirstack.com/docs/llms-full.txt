* **Complete Access**: Combine both historical and daily updates for comprehensive data coverage.

## How to access datasets

You can access and manage datasets through the [TheirStack App](https://app.theirstack.com/dataset). The dataset page provides comprehensive information and tools:

* Last update date
* Total record count
* Data dictionary
* Sample data download
* Dictionary download
* Full dataset download (requires access)
* Data refresh frequency

![Datasets page](./dataset-page.png)

## How to get lastest dataset link

In order to get the latest dataset link to downlaad, you need to do a /GET request to the [dataset endpoint](https://api.theirstack.com/#tag/datasets/GET/v1/datasets).

## Frequently Asked Questions

## June 10, 2025

* üÜï **Unified search experience for job and company searches**. To improve control and prevent accidental queries, searches in job and company pages no longer run automatically. You now need to click the "Search" button after setting your filters. This is especially helpful for complex searches on historical data.

* üêû Fixed an issue where some job titles weren't displaying special characters correctly. For example, 'Growth Analyst (AI & Search Architecture)' now appears as 'Growth Analyst (AI & Search Architecture)'. This fix applies to all new jobs going forward.

## June 9, 2025

* üî® **Better loading experience in the App**. When you search for jobs or companies, you'll now see a loading banner that shows how many jobs or companies are being searched, along with logos from the main job sources.

* üî® **Database timeout status code change**: The HTTP status code returned for database query timeouts has been changed from `408 (Request Timeout)` to `504 (Gateway Timeout)`.

  A `504` code indicates a server-side timeout rather than a client-side one, which better reflects what's actually happening when a database query takes too long. If you were handling 408 errors before, you'll have to update your code to handle `504` errors instead.

## June 6, 2025

* üÜï **New job description filter `contains any` in [Job Search page](https://app.theirstack.com/search/jobs/new) and [Jobs Search endpoint](https://api.theirstack.com/#tag/jobs/POST/v1/jobs/search)**.

  Until now, searching in job descriptions required using regex patterns, which wasn't very user-friendly for non-technical users.

  We have added `job_description_contains_or` param to our API to allow you to search for whole words in job descriptions. Only finds complete words (e.g., searching 'quality' won't match 'inequality').

  More technical information about how this filter works can be found in the [API docs](https://api.theirstack.com/#tag/jobs/POST/v1/jobs/search).

![New job description filter](./job-description-contains-any.png)

* üÜï **Profile page**. You can now update your first and last name in your [profile page](https://app.theirstack.com/settings/profile).

* üÜï **No results message** in job and company searches. When your search doesn't return any results, you'll now see a clearer, more helpful message‚Äîespecially on small screens.

## June 4, 2025

* üÜï **Jobs are now 3x cheaper**. Read more about it in [this blog post](/en/blog/jobs-are-now-up-to-3x-cheaper).

## June 3, 2025

* **Improved the performance** of job searches and company searches by **up to 30x** when using some of the following filters:

  * `company_name_partial_match_or`
  * `company_name_partial_match_not`
  * `company_location_pattern_or`
  * `company_description_pattern_or`
  * `company_description_pattern_not`
  * `job_title_pattern_or`
  * `job_title_pattern_not`
  * `job_location_pattern_not`
  * `job_description_pattern_not`

  This will have effect especially when passing large arrays of values in them (of 50+ elements). Queries that before would take \~50 seconds are now taking 2-3 seconds, according to our tests.

## May 29, 2025

* üÜï **Improved extraction of matching phrases**. Before, when filtering jobs by keywords in the jobs description, even if the keywords or patterns in the description of the jobs, the matching\_phrases and matching\_words were empty. Now, we extract the matching phrases and words from the description of the jobs.

![Improved extraction of matching phrases](./matching_phrases_fixed.png)

* üÜï **Added new tachnologies**. We reparsed our full database to add new technologies. They're now available in company searches, job searches and in our datasets. These are the new technologies added:

## May 27, 2025

* üÜï **New filters `url_domain_or` and `url_domain_not` in [Jobs Search endpoint](https://api.theirstack.com/#tag/jobs/POST/v1/jobs/search)** and [Company Search endpoint](https://api.theirstack.com/#tag/companies/POST/v1/companies/search). This filter allows you to get jobs from specific domains: greenhouse.io, workable.com, linkedin.com, etc.

* üìö **Adding examples for each filter in the API docs**. This is helpful to understand how to use the filters and see some possible values.

![examples for each filter](./examples-filters-api-docs.png)

## May 22, 2025

* üî® **API Error Handling**: We've standardized the error experience across all endpoints. The error object now consistently includes `request_id`, `code`, `title`, and `message`.

## May 21, 2025

* üìö **New guide**: [How to send a slack message for every new job found](/docs/posts/guides/how-to-send-jobs-to-slack)

## May 20, 2025

* üÜï **Error handling**: We've improved the error handling in the app. Now the notification will show better titles and descriptions so you can understand what went wrong.

![Error handling](./error-handling.png)

## May 16, 2025

* üÜï **Export data with revealed records**: You can now export all records from already revealed companies. This is useful if you want to export data without consuming credits.

![Export data from only revealed records](./export-only-revealed.png)

## May 7, 2025

* üÜï **Stable company logo URLs**:\
  Previously, when scraping new jobs, we stored direct logo URLs from external sources. These links often broke due to expiration or CORS issues. We've updated our process to copy and host logo images on our own infrastructure. All newly detected companies will now use a permanent URL format: `https://media.theirstack.com/company/logo/xxx`.\
  These links are stable and can be used anywhere.

* üÜï **Slow company searches are now 2-6x faster ‚ö°Ô∏è**\
  Company searches that before took too long or were just impossible to run just take seconds. This would typically happen when adding job or technology filters to the search. Here are examples of such queries: - Companies using Snowflake, with a high confidence score in the usage of that technology, from the US. Now it completes in [less than 5 seconds](https://app.theirstack.com/search/companies/new?query=JTdCJTIycXVlcnklMjIlM0ElN0IlMjJpbmNsdWRlX3RvdGFsX3Jlc3VsdHMlMjIlM0FmYWxzZSUyQyUyMm9yZGVyX2J5JTIyJTNBJTVCJTdCJTIyZGVzYyUyMiUzQXRydWUlMkMlMjJmaWVsZCUyMiUzQSUyMmNvbmZpZGVuY2UlMjIlN0QlMkMlN0IlMjJkZXNjJTIyJTNBdHJ1ZSUyQyUyMmZpZWxkJTIyJTNBJTIyam9icyUyMiU3RCUyQyU3QiUyMmRlc2MlMjIlM0F0cnVlJTJDJTIyZmllbGQlMjIlM0ElMjJudW1fam9icyUyMiU3RCU1RCUyQyUyMmNvbXBhbnlfY291bnRyeV9jb2RlX29yJTIyJTNBJTVCJTIyVVMlMjIlNUQlMkMlMjJjb21wYW55X3RlY2hub2xvZ3lfc2x1Z19vciUyMiUzQSU1QiUyMnNub3dmbGFrZSUyMiU1RCUyQyUyMnRlY2hfZmlsdGVycyUyMiUzQSU3QiUyMmNvbmZpZGVuY2Vfb3IlMjIlM0ElNUIlMjJoaWdoJTIyJTVEJTdEJTJDJTIyZXhwYW5kX3RlY2hub2xvZ3lfc2x1Z3MlMjIlM0ElNUIlNUQlN0QlMkMlMjJhdXRvX3NlYXJjaCUyMiUzQXRydWUlN0Q=) - Companies hiring data engineers in the US, UK or Canada.

These and other slow queries are now 2-6x faster. These is how long queries would take before and after the improvement:

| Time before          | Time now | Improvement |

| Timeouts (at 2 mins) | 20-35s   | \~6x faster |

## May 6, 2025

* üÜï **New docs**: We have revamped [our docs](https://theirstack.com/en/docs) to make it easier to discover TheirStack and its features.
  * **Navigation**: Added a new sidebar to the left of the page to help you navigate the docs in a more intuitive way.
  * **Merge similar pages**: We've merged similar pages to avoid duplication and make it easier to learn about new topics.
  * **New dataset page**: We've added a new page to the docs to help you learn about our datasets.

## April 15, 2025

* üÜï **New webhook setting `trigger once per company`**. When enabled, the webhook will fire only once for each company. This is helpful for sales workflows where you want to act on the first job posted (e.g., send an email, add to a CRM) without triggering the workflow for every subsequent job from the same company.
  * Example: If active, Company A with 5 jobs ‚Üí 1 event triggered. If deactivated, Company A with 5 jobs ‚Üí 5 events triggered.
  * If you turn this on for an existing webhook, it will prevent duplicate companies from triggering events going forward. However, companies already sent before enabling the setting won't be remembered, so their jobs may still trigger events.

![Trigger once per company](./trigger-once-per-company.png)

* üÜï **Webhook usage analytics**: Track individual webhook performance and credit consumption with a detailed breakdown chart. View which webhooks are using the most credits on the [usage page](https://app.theirstack.com/settings/usage).

  * Added ability to customize credit allocation when updating your subscription plan. You can select any number of credits you want to be added to your account.

## April 2, 2025

* üêû **Resolved two issues affecting app users in [company search](https://app.theirstack.com/search/companies)**:
  * When filtering by technology category (e.g. "CRM Platforms") not showing a column per technology (e.g. "Salesforce", "Hubspot", "Zoho"...).
  * When exporting a list of companies filtering by technology category, there was not a column for each technology of the category.
  * When changing the technology filter, the table was filtering by the new technology, but a column was still showing the old technology.

## April 1, 2025

* üÜï *New button to open a search from the API request*. You can now open a search from the API request modal by clicking on the "Open search" button.

## March 11, 2025

* üìö New [webhooks docs](/docs/webhooks)
* üìö Improved [Clay docs](/docs/clay)
* üìö Enhanced [Backfilling job board](/docs/backfill-job-board) post

## March 10, 2025

* üÜï **Webhooks Observability**: You can now view the response body and status code for each webhook. Additionally, you can filter events by their status (success or failure) and determine if a failure was due to a timeout.
* üÜï **Webhooks Retry Mechanism**: Failed webhooks are now automatically retried every hour for up to 48 hours.
* üÜï **New v2.0.0 for the Technographics dataset**. Includes new columns, and renames some existing ones for consistency. Now includes columns for the 3 current sources of technographics data we have:

## January 14, 2025

* üÜï **New filter `job_seniority_or` in our [Jobs API](https://api.theirstack.com/#tag/jobs/POST/v1/jobs/search)**. This filter allows you to search for jobs by seniority level.

* üÜï **Shortened URL detection for new jobs and companies**. Our system now identifies shortened URLs (e.g., `bit.ly`, `tinyurl`, etc.) for newly discovered jobs and companies. Instead of storing the shortened URL in our database, we now retrieve and save the original URL.

* üêû **Fixed an issue causing duplicate job postings**. A job is considered a duplicate if the same company posts the same job title within a 30-day window.

There are 2 roles in a team:

* **Member**: Can do everything except what admins can do.
* **Owner**:
  * Can add and remove team members.
  * Can change other members' roles.
  * Receives consumption alerts. Eg: when 75% of the credits are used.

![Webhooks details page](./webhook-details-page.png)

## What are webhooks?

Webhooks allow you to send data when specific events occur (new jobs, tech changes, etc) to external systems like N8N, Zapier, Make, Airtable, your own webhook endpoint, etc.

For instance, you can configure a webhook to alert you when a new job is listed in a particular location, company, or technology sector.

Webhooks are dependent on a search, which defines the criteria for triggering the webhook. Any type of searches (job, company, technology, etc) can be used to trigger a webhook.

### Webhooks Applications

* Initiate a workflow in an automation tool like Zapier, Make, N8N when a new job is posted or a company adopts a new technology (e.g., Snowflake, Hubspot, Python).
* Send a Slack notification to your team when a new job is found or a company adopts a new technology (e.g., Snowflake, Hubspot, Python).
* Automatically update a Google Sheet with new job or company data.
* Trigger an email alert to a specific distribution list when a new job matches certain criteria.
* Create a table in Airtable to store job listings.
* Integrate with a CRM system to add new company information as leads.

### Webhook types

There are three types of webhooks:

* **`job.new`**: Triggered when a new job is discovered by TheirsStack matching the search criteria.
* **`company.new`**: Triggered when a new company is discovered by TheirsStack matching the search criteria.
* **`tech.new`**: Triggered when company adopts a new technology (request access to this)

Webhooks and API requests share the same pricing. When an event is triggered, it consumes 1 (`job.new`) or 3 (`company.new`, `tech.new`) API credits based on the type of event. Learn more about our credit system [here](/en/docs/pricing-and-billing/credits).

## How to set up a webhook

<YoutubeIframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gbd8IMgL-Rw" title="Webhooks" />

Follow these steps to set up a webhook:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Open a new job or company search with the criteria you are interested in.**

    <div className="flex gap-2">
      <Link href={'https://app.theirstack.com/search/jobs/new'} target="_blank">
        <Button>New job search <ExternalLinkIcon className="ml-2 w-4 h-4" /></Button>
      </Link>

      <Link href={'https://app.theirstack.com/search/companies/new'} target="_blank">
        <Button>New company search <ExternalLinkIcon className="ml-2 w-4 h-4" /></Button>
      </Link>
    </div>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Click on the "Save" button to save the search.**

    The search has to be saved to be used in the webhook.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Click on the "Webhooks" button on the top right corner.**

    ![Saved search](./webhook-saved-search.png)
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Click on the "Create Webhook" button.**
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Fill the form**

    ![New webhook modal](./new-webhook-modal.png)

    * **`Saved search`**: This search's filters determine which records will trigger the webhook.

    * **`Trigger once per company`**: When enabled, the webhook will fire only once for each company. This is helpful for sales workflows where you want to act on the first job posted (e.g., send an email, add to a CRM) without triggering the workflow for every subsequent job from the same company. Eg: If active, Company A with 5 jobs ‚Üí 1 event triggered. If deactivated, Company A with 5 jobs ‚Üí 5 events triggered.

    * **`Choose where to start`**: You can choose whether to start listening from this point forward or from the start of the search. If you choose to start from the start of the search, you will receive all events that have occurred since the search was created.

    * **`Webhook URL`**: The URL of the webhook endpoint you want to send the data to. You can click on "Send test event" to send a sample of the data to your webhook URL and verify that it is working.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Wait for new events to be triggered**

    ![Webhook details page](./webhook-details-page-no-events.png)

    * If you choose to start from the start of the search, you will receive all events that have occurred since the search was created in a few seconds. If you choose to start from the current date, you will receive events in real time.
    * You can click on the button "Send test event" to send a sample of the data to your webhook URL and verify that it is working.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How to monitor webhook usage

You can monitor webhook usage in the [Usage page](https://theirsstack.com/usage).

You can break down the usage by event status or webhook.

![Webhook usage](./webhook-usage.png)

## Webhooks API

You can manage programmatically your webhooks by using the [Webhooks API](https://api.theirstack.com/#tag/webhooks). This is specially useful if you want to integrate webhooks with your own application.

## Your own webhook endpoint

If you are builing your own webhook endpoint, please take into account the following:

* Return a 200 status code to indicate that the webhook event was received and processed successfully. Failed webhook events are retried every hour for 48 hours.
* Your webhook endpoint has to be prepared to handle at least 2 concurrent requests.
* Your webhook endpoint has to be prepared to handle duplicates. Our system is designed to not send the same job twice to your webhook URL. However, this could happen in some edge cases (e.g: you listen to two searches with not exclusive jobs). You can use the `id` field to deduplicate jobs.
* When a webhook sends data, it uses an HTTP POST request, with a JSON payload.

## Faqs

<Accordions>
  <Accordion id="what-happens-when-i-run-out-of-api-credits" title="What happens to webhook events when I run out of API credits?">
    When you run out of API credits, webhook event monitoring is temporarily paused. During this period, no new events will appear in your webhook history. Monitoring automatically resumes once you purchase additional API credits.

    Whether you miss events during the pause depends on your search criteria. For example, if your webhook tracks jobs posted within the last 60 days and you lack credits for 2 days, you won't miss anything - when credits are restored, all jobs discovered during the pause will still trigger your webhook as they match your search parameters.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion id="what-happens-if-the-webhook-event-fails" title="What happens if the webhook event fails?">
    If the webhook event fails, it will be automatically retried every hour for 48 hours.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion id="how-much-cost-to-run-a-webhook" title="How much cost to run a webhook?">
    Webhook events are billed at the same rate as API requests. They consume 1 API credit per event.
  </Accordion>

import { LaptopIcon, WebhookIcon, CodeIcon, DatabaseIcon } from 'lucide-react'

TheirStack is the largest job posting and technographics database.

We continuously gather job listings from a variety of job boards, ATSs, and company websites. Our goal isn't to assist individuals in finding jobs or companies in recruiting talent.

Instead, we view job postings as a gold mine of information. When a company posts a job, it signals a need to address a problem or seize an opportunity. Job postings reveal the technologies they use, the tasks they need help with, their working methods, and organizational structure - offering the perfect timing to reach out to your lead.

We transform job postings into buying intent signals, helping sales and marketing teams make informed decisions for higher ROI.

* **Hiring Signals:** Discover companies that are hiring for specific positions.
* **Technographic Signals:** Discover companies by the technology they use.
* **Painpoint Signals:** Discover companies that have have a specific painpoint: digitalize invoices, automate onboarding, backup data, etc.

title: Free count
description: Learn how to get the count of records that match your search criteria without consuming API credits.
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/api/free-count
---

Our [Job Search](https://api.theirstack.com/#tag/jobs/POST/v1/jobs/search) and [Company Search](https://api.theirstack.com/#tag/companies/POST/v1/companies/search) endpoints include a free count feature that allows you to estimate the number of records that match your search criteria without consuming API credits.

## Steps to use free count

To effectively use the Free Count feature, follow these steps:

1. Enable Total Results: Set the `include_total_results` field to `true`. This will ensure that the total number of matching records is included in the response.
2. Blur Company Data: Set the `blur_company_data` field to `true`. This step is necessary to maintain data privacy while using the free count.
3. Limit Results: Set the `limit` field to `1`. This minimizes the data returned and makes the request faster, focusing solely on the count.

By following these steps, you can efficiently estimate the number of records that match your search criteria without consuming any API credits.

title: Preview data mode
description: Learn how to preview TheirStack data without consuming API credits.

---

Our [Job Search](https://api.theirstack.com/#tag/jobs/POST/v1/jobs/search) and [Company Search](https://api.theirstack.com/#tag/companies/POST/v1/companies/search) endpoints include a preview mode that return the same data but some fields are blurred.

This mode is useful for [sales sofware](/en/docs/guides/sales-software-integration-guide) building products with TheirStack data. It allows you to show a preview of the data to your end users without consuming credits. It's the same we use in our own [app](https://app.theirstack.com).

## How to use preview mode

To use preview mode, you need to set the `blur_company_data` field to `true` in the request body.

## Company search preview

When doing a company search with preview mode, the response will return all fields but the `company_name`, `company_domain`, `company_linkedin_url` fields will be blurred.

![Preview data mode](./blur-company-search.png)

## Job search preview

When doing a job search with preview mode, the response will return all fields but the `job_description`, `job_url`, `company_name`, `company_domain`, `company_linkedin_url` fields will be blurred.

title: Company lookup
description: Easily search for any company name or website on TheirStack. View their technologies and job listings with a simple click.
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/app/company-lookup
---

There is a search box in the header of TheirStack where you can look for any company or its domain.

<video src="/static/generated/docs/posts/app/company-lookup.mp4" controls className="w-full" />

When you click on one of them, a modal will open on the right side of your screen. Let's take Deutsche Bank for example:

For every company, you'll see that there are 3 tabs:

* **Overview** to see firmographic data about the company: industry, size, location, etc.
* **Technologies** where you can see the technologies that the company uses
* **Jobs** where you can see the jobs from this company

## Technology tab

When you click on Technology Category, you can type one to see only technologies from that category.

For example, in the case of the Big Data as a Service category, we see that this company has mentioned BigQuery 35 times, and 75% of the mentions in this category are of BigQuery, whereas Snowflake was only mentioned 5 times:

![Technology tab](./technology-tab.png)

This is why the confidence assigned to this company using Snowflake was low, while the confidence to them using BigQuery was high.

import YoutubeIframe from '@/components/youtube-iframe'

Finding companies ready to buy your product is one of the biggest challenges sales teams face. Often your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) is strongly linked to a technology or group of technologies.

TheirStack is a sales tool designed to discover purchase intent signals through job postings. It helps SaaS companies, recruiting agencies and consulting firms to find their next customer by analyzing 40+ million job listings across 100+ countries.

<YoutubeIframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e3wisJYuVVk" title="Webhooks" />

## Get a list of companies by the technology they use

### Step 1. Open a new company search

Go to your app and click on "Search Companies"

![Open company search](./open-company-search.png)

### Step 2. Filter companies by technology

On the¬†Company Technology¬†filter, start typing a technology and select one or more.

![Company technology filter](./company-technology-filter.png)

add more filters like Company Country, Industry, Company Employees...

![More filters](./more-filters.png)

Here is what each one of the columns shows:

* **Category**: each technology belongs to a category. One category groups more than one technology, typically related to the same field.
* **Jobs**: the number of jobs where each company has mentioned each technology
* **Ocurrence within category**: shows how common one technology is compared to other technologies in the same category, for each company
* **Theirstack Score**: a metric that combines jobs and relative occurrance within category. The idea is that the more jobs a company has mentioning a technology, and the more one technology is mentioned VS similar ones in the same category, the more likely is that the company uses this technology.
* **Rank within category**: if a company mentions 3 technologies of a category in their jobs, the most frequent one will have rank 1, and the least frequent one in their jobs rank 3

Besides these, there are other columns whose names are self-explanatory: Company size, Company Industry, Company Country and more

### Step 3. Seeing the sources of our data

By clicking on the number of jobs found mentioning that technology, you will be able to check the job postings were this technology was mentioned

title: TheirStack vs BrightData
description: Looking for the best job data solution? Compare TheirStack and BrightData side by side. While BrightData offers basic job scraping for platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, TheirStack provides a comprehensive, real-time job data platform with advanced filtering, instant results, and seamless integration. Discover which solution best fits your needs in this detailed comparison guide.
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/comparisons/theirstack-vs-brightdata
---

## Quick Decision Guide

**Choose TheirStack if**

* You need a real-time solution that responds in 100ms-2s
* You want a fast and easy integration with a single API call
* You want to filter by attributes like company countries, industries, company sizes, job description, etc
* You want all the jobs from all the job boards in one place and don't want to handle job deduplication.

**Choose BrightData if**

* You don't need a real-time solution and are fine waiting 4-5 minutes for each job search.
* You're comfortable implementing a complex integration with multiple API calls, retry logic, and snapshot storage.
* You don't need extensive filtering capabilities
* You're prepared to manage separate processes for each job board and handle job deduplication yourself.

## What is BrightData?

BrightData is a general purpose web data extraction platform, so jobs per se are not their main focus. On the other hand, jobs is at the core of what we do at TheirStack. So 100% of our effort is in building a high-quality, end-to-end job data platform.

### Development cost and complexity

BrightData's integration is complex:

* It requires at least two API calls for each search: one to create the search and another to retrieve the results.
* You'll need to save in your database the snapshot ID of each search so that you can retrieve the results later.
* You'll need to implement retry logic since the data isn't immediately available and can take several minutes to be ready.
* There is no pagination so you will likely miss some jobs
* If you need to search in multiple job boards,
  * you'll need separate API calls for each source
  * you'll need to handle job deduplication on your side because job boards share most of their jobs.

TheirStack integration is straightforward with just a single API call needed. You can find our complete documentation [here](https://api.theirstack.com/#tag/jobs/POST/v1/jobs/search).

### Response time

When you make a request to TheirStack, we make a search in our database, which already contains millions of jobs scraped from [thousands of job boards and websites](/en/docs/job-sources). The response comes back almost instantly - 90% of our requests finish in less than 2 seconds.

For example, to get the last data analyst jobs posted in NYC in the last 7 days with us you'd make this call:

```bash
curl --request POST \
--url "https://api.theirstack.com/v1/jobs/search" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <api_key>" \
--data '{
  "posted_at_max_age_days": 7,
  "job_country_code_or": [
    "US"
  ],
  "job_title_or": [
    "data analyst"
  ],
  "job_location_pattern_or": [
    "new york",
    "nyc"
  ]
}'
```

In BrightData, when you make a search they do a live call to their job boards to get the data. This process involves 2 calls and the results not only aren't instant but take **minutes** to come back.

To get the same data as in the previous example, first you'd make a call like this:

```bash
curl --request POST \
--url "https://api.brightdata.com/datasets/v3/trigger?dataset_id=gd_lpfll7v5hcqtkxl6l&include_errors=true&type=discover_new&discover_by=keyword&limit_per_input=5" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <bearer_token>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '[
  {
    "location": "New York",
    "keyword": "data analyst",
    "country": "US",
    "time_range": "Past week",
    "job_type": "",
    "experience_level": "",
    "remote": "",
    "company": ""
  }
]'
```

The result of this would not be the data directly, but a snapshot ID like this:

```json
{
    "snapshot_id": "s_m5o15lt05g12b9s1x"
}
```

You'd then need to make a second call to get the data:

```bash
curl --request GET \
--url "https://api.brightdata.com/datasets/v3/snapshot/s_m5o15lt0rn12b9s1x?format=json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <bearer_token>"
```

From our tests, this requests takes 8-10s to complete, and even after 3 or 4 minutes, the data isn't ready yet and we'd get responses like this:

```json
{
    "status": "running",
    "message": "Snapshot is not ready yet, try again in 10s"
}
```

This invalidates using BrightData for any real-time use case you might have related to jobs. But not only that.

### Extensive filtering capabilities

BrightData just lets you filter by the limited set of filters LinkedIn supports.

TheirStack lets you filter by many filters that LinkedIn or BrightData don't support and won't support anytime soon. To name a few:

* **Company filters:** By industry, size, country, revenue, funding, URL, LinkedIn URL or slug, etc.
* **Job filters:** By title, description, country, city, remote options, salary, etc. Regular expression filters are supported by many fields like title, description or locations

### Historical data

BrightData only provides access to recent job postings, with limited historical data availability.

TheirStack maintains a comprehensive historical database of jobs dating back to 2019, allowing you to access and analyze job postings across much larger time spans.

### Comprehensive documentation.

BrightData's job scraping API documentation is limited and requires frequent communication with support to understand parameter usage and functionality.

We are an API-first company, so our [Job Search API](https://api.theirstack.com/#tag/jobs/POST/v1/jobs/search) is at the core of what we do and we talk with users daily to make it better and add new filters and features they need. We put great care into the developer experience, and you can tell so by visiting the link above and seeing how well documented our API is, so that you don't have to waste time figuring out how each parameter works or talking to support to get help.

### Job consolidation across multiple job boards

BrightData offers LinkedIn, Indeed and Glassdoor job scrapers. We scrape those and more job boards, having jobs from tens of thousands of domains.

With BrightData you would need to use one individual scraper per each job board, and then consolidate jobs into a central repository.

With TheirStack, we consolidate jobs from all of them into a single database and provide a single API endpoint to access them so that you can get all the jobs you want with a single request, instead of having to make multiple requests to different scrapers.

### Job deduplication

Because BrightData has different endpoints for each job board, they don't handle job deduplication across them. But it happens many times that the same job appears on multiple job boards.

As we offer a single entrypoint for all our job data, we have built our own job deduplication algorithm that lets us identify if the same job has already been scraped. Therefore, you won't get the same job twice and you won't have to worry about handling job deduplication yourself.

title: TheirStack vs BuiltWith
description: Compare TheirStack and BuiltWith to find the best technographic database for your needs. Learn how TheirStack offers broader technology coverage, real-time webhooks, and confidence scoring, while BuiltWith specializes in web technology tracking.
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/comparisons/theirstack-vs-builtwith
---

Builwith and TheirStack are a technographic databases that provide tools for lead generation, market research, and business intelligence.

## Quick Decision Guide

**Choose TheirStack if:**

* You need to know who is using technologies that are not web technologies: CRMs, ERPs, databases, ATS, programming languages, etc.
* You want to leverage Webhooks to trigger actions as soon as you detect a new technology used by a company.

**Choose BuiltWith if:**

* You need to know who is using a specific web technology: CMSs, E-commerce platforms, payment processors, etc.

## What is BuiltWith?

BuiltWith is a web analytics platform that provides detailed insights into website traffic, market share, and audience demographics. It offers a range of tools and data to help businesses understand their online presence and competitors.

## Data sources

Our approach to sourcing tech usage data sets us apart from BuiltWith in a few key ways. First, we offer a broader technology catalog that includes not only web technologies but also CRMs, ERPs, databases, and various internal tools. BuiltWith focuses solely on web technologies.

Additionally, instead of tracking websites, we gather data from job postings. Each month, we collect job listings from millions of companies by monitoring company websites, job boards, and other hiring platforms. When a job listing mentions a specific technology in the title or description, it indicates that the company likely uses that technology. We then assign a Confidence Score (low, medium, high) based on the frequency and context of these mentions to estimate how likely the company is to use that technology.

## Pricing

Our pricing model is also unique. While BuiltWith charges based on technology reports, we base our pricing on the number of companies returned in your search.

title: TheirStack vs Coresignal
description: Compare TheirStack and Coresignal to find the best job data solution. While Coresignal offers extensive datasets and APIs for company, employee, and job data, TheirStack provides a comprehensive, real-time job data platform with advanced filtering, instant results, and seamless integration. Discover which solution best fits your needs in this detailed comparison guide.
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/comparisons/theirstack-vs-coresignal
---

TheirStack and Coresignal are both data providers that offer job and company data.

## Quick Decision Guide

**Choose TheirStack if**

* You need deduplicated job data from over 16,000 sources including LinkedIn, Indeed, and ATS platforms.
* You want a single API to access jobs combined and deduplicated from multiple sources (LinkedIn, Indeed and [16k+ more](/en/docs/data/job/sources)).
* You value the possibility of making job searches filtering by company attributes (for example, "give me jobs from US companies" or "give me jobs from companies under 1000 employees")
* You value the possibility of making company searches filtering by job attributes (for example, "give me companies hiring SDRs" or "give me companies with Python jobs")
* You need mostly jobs and company data, and you care about not paying too much for it.

**Choose Coresignal if**

* You need employee data (email, experience, skills, etc.). Coresignal's employee data is very good.
* You want highly detailed company data (including news, financials, etc.). Coresignal's company data is very good as well.
* You don't need to make company searches filtering by their jobs, or job searches filtering by company attributes.
* If you want jobs, you're OK with getting only jobs from LinkedIn.
* You don't mind paying more for fewer jobs than you could get with TheirStack.

## What is Coresignal?

Coresignal is a data provider focused on 3 kinds of datasets:

* Jobs data
* Company data
* Employee data

Up to this date, all of Coresignal's data comes from LinkedIn. Even though t
Coresignal's interface is API only and there is no way to explore the data visually.\
Coresignal has a free plan, but in small plans the costs per credit are very high, up to $0.2 per job. They are sales-led and their pricing is heavily weighted towards customers buying expensive plans, needed to support their sales team.\
To fetch jobs with Coresignal, you need to use 2 API endpoints: `search` to get the job data and `collect` to get the job data.

## What is TheirStack

TheirStack is a data provider focused on 3 kinds of datasets:

* Jobs data

TheirStack combines jobs data from multiple sources and deduplicates them.\
TheirStack has a free plan and put a lot of effort into the developer experience and into making the product as self-service as possible.\
TheirStack's pricing is thought to be able to support both customers starting out as well as bigger customers with higher usage needs.\
With a single API, TheirStack customers can fetch jobs data, making it easier to build integrations and estimate costs.\
TheirStack offers a UI that can be used to explore the data visually, export it, integrate with other sources and also works as an API playground to learn how to use the API.

title: TheirStack vs Similarweb
description: Compare TheirStack and Similarweb to find the best solution for your needs. Learn how TheirStack offers technographic data and real-time webhooks, while SimilarWeb specializes in web traffic and market intelligence.
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/comparisons/theirstack-vs-similarweb
---

SimilarWeb and TheirStack are powerful tools that serve different purposes in the business intelligence space. While SimilarWeb focuses on web traffic and market intelligence, TheirStack specializes in technographic data and real-time technology usage tracking.

## Quick Decision Guide

**Choose TheirStack if:**

* You need to know which companies are using internal tools like CRMs, ERPs, databases, programming languages, etc.
* You want real-time notifications when companies adopt new technologies
* You're looking for technographic data to power your sales and marketing efforts

**Choose SimilarWeb if:**

* You need detailed web traffic analytics and market intelligence
* You want to understand your competitors' digital performance
* You're interested in audience insights and market share analysis

## What is SimilarWeb?

SimilarWeb is a web analytics platform that provides detailed insights into website traffic, market share, and audience demographics. It offers a range of tools and data to help businesses understand their online presence and competitors.

## Data sources

Our approach to data collection differs significantly from SimilarWeb. While SimilarWeb primarily focuses on web traffic data through browser extensions, panel data, and direct measurement, we gather our data from job postings. Each month, we collect job listings from millions of companies by monitoring company websites, job boards, and other hiring platforms. When a job listing mentions a specific technology in the title or description, it indicates that the company likely uses that technology. We then assign a Confidence Score (low, medium, high) based on the frequency and context of these mentions.

## Pricing

Our pricing model is based on the number of companies returned in your search, making it more predictable and scalable for businesses of all sizes. SimilarWeb's pricing is typically based on the level of access to their traffic data and market intelligence features.

* You're interested in browser-based technology profiling

## What is Wappalyzer?

Wappalyzer is a browser extension that identifies the technologies used by websites. It offers a range of tools and data to help businesses understand their online presence and competitors.

## Data sources

TheirStack gathers data from job postings, collecting job listings from millions of companies by monitoring company websites, job boards, and other hiring platforms. This approach allows for a broader understanding of technology usage beyond just web technologies. Wappalyzer, on the other hand, uses a browser extension and in-house crawlers to identify technologies used on websites, providing instant results and detailed technology profiles.

## Pricing

TheirStack's pricing model is based on the number of companies returned in your search, making it scalable for businesses of all sizes. Wappalyzer offers a tiered pricing model with options for individuals and businesses, providing a greater number of technology lookups at each plan tier.

  <AlertTitle>Beta Feature Available</AlertTitle>

  <AlertDescription>
    We now offer a new `/companies/search/domains` endpoint that's perfect for this use case and can significantly
    reduce your API costs. This endpoint is currently in beta. Please [contact us](mailto:hi@theirstack.com) to
    request access.
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

At TheirStack, we're obsessed with helping sales intelligence platforms give their users the best data. We know that building a great company search is key to helping your users find the right companies. But to have a truly powerful company search, you need plenty of filters‚Äîand let's be honest, each data provider excels at specific data points.

If you're a sales tech company that already has your own database of companies and runs searches against it, but you'd like to add technology filters to enhance your search capabilities, TheirStack is the perfect solution.

TheirStack can help you add the following filters to your existing company database:

* **Technologies**: A catalogue of 21k+ technologies to filter by technology stack
* **Job postings**: A catalogue of 110M+ job postings to filter by hiring patterns

![Generic company search](./generic-company-search.png)

## The optimal workflow to minimize API costs

When you already have a company database and want to add technology filtering, the most cost-effective approach is to leverage our new domains endpoint. Here's how it works:

Let's say your user is searching for *"Companies in the US, with more than 100 employees, that use Snowflake, and raised more than $10M"*.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Run your existing filters on your own database first (optional but recommended):**

    Filter your company database by the criteria you already have:

    * `country`: US
    * `employee_count`: more than 100
    * `raised_amount`: more than $10M

    This step is optional but highly recommended to avoid sending us companies that aren't in your database. If you want to show 100 results to your users, consider getting 200, 500, or even the full list of domains that match your filters from your internal database. This ensures you have enough companies to work with after our filtering.

    Remember: you can pass us a list as big as you want‚Äîour pricing is only based on the number of results we send back to you, not the number of domains you send us.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Call our new Company Domains API (Beta):**

    Pass the domains from your pre-filtered list of companies to our `/companies/search/domains` endpoint:

    * `company_domain_or`: list of domains from step 1 (or all your domains if you skipped step 1)
    * `company_technology_slug_or`: `snowflake`
    * `limit`: 100 (to get only the first 100 results‚Äîset this to the number of results you'll show to your users to save credits)

    You can also apply additional filters here to further narrow down results if needed, like job filters. The complete parameter list is available in our [API documentation](https://api.theirstack.com).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Filter your original results:**

    Take the domains returned by our API and filter your original company list from step 1 to show only companies whose domains appear in our response.

    This gives you the final list of companies that match all criteria, including technology usage.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Alternative: Purchase our technographics dataset

Another way to add technology filtering would be to purchase our complete technographics dataset and run queries internally. However, this approach has several drawbacks compared to the API:

* **More development work**: You'll need to build infrastructure to handle an additional dataset
* **Data management overhead**: You'll need to manage and store our technographics data alongside your existing company database
* **Sync complexity**: We provide daily updates, but you'll need to resync your entire technographics table regularly, downloading and repopulating the full dataset
* **Higher upfront costs**: This requires a significant initial investment compared to pay-as-you-go API usage
* **Less flexibility**: The API approach lets you validate our data quality first and only pay for what you actually use

With the API approach, you get always up-to-date information without the infrastructure overhead, and you can start small to validate the value before scaling up.

title: Backfilling a job board
description: Learn why TheirStack is the best job board backfill solution and how to backfill a job board using webhooks
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/guides/backfill-job-board
---

## What is backfilling a job board?

Backfilling a job board involves augmenting its own job listings with external postings from various sources. This integration allows job boards to present a broader array of opportunities to their users, helping to attract more traffic, boost user engagement, and ultimately enhance their overall value proposition.

import { Alert, AlertDescription, AlertTitle } from '@/shared/ui/base/alert'
import { TriangleAlert } from 'lucide-react'

## Why TheirStack is the best job board backfill solution

Backfilling job boards is a common use case for our Job data platform and it was built with this in mind:

* **Original job link to company website** When a job originates from a company's career page, we include the URL (`final_url`) so you can redirect users to the correct source. You can also get only jobs from career pages with the `final_url_exists` filter.
* **Standardized job descriptions** Our job descriptions are standardized across all information sources in Markdown format, ensuring consistency.
* **Company information** Most of our jobs are enriched with company information, so can use the company `logo`, `domain`, `industry`, `headcount`, `revenue`, `type`, `location` and technologies used for your company profile page. Additionally, media assets such as company logos are downloaded and stored in our own infrastructure, allowing you to access them reliably via stable URLs for use in your own applications.
* **Up-to-date data** The data is up-to-date, with new jobs being added to our database every minute.
* **Filters** If you are a niche job board, you can use the `job_title_or` filter to get specific jobs, or the company `industry_id_or` filter to get only jobs from companies in a specific industry or any of our 20+ filters.
* **16k+ job data sources** so you can get a wide range of jobs from all over the world. [Learn more](/en/docs/job-sources)

## How to backfill a job board

You have two options:

### Webhook (Recommended)

Set up a webhook to listen for the `new.job` event. By applying the necessary filters, you can ensure that you only receive the job postings that meet your specific criteria. This approach allows you to automatically receive new job listings as soon as they are published.

* Step 1 - Create a job search with your desired criteria (e.g: location, company, technology, etc). You can create as many as you want. It's important to create exclusive criteria to avoid receiving duplicate job postings.

* Step 2 - Set up a webhook to listen for the `new.job` event. [How to set up a webhook](/en/docs/webhooks)

### API

<Alert variant="warning">
  <AlertDescription>
    We strongly recommend using our [webhooks](/docs/webhooks) instead of the Jobs API to fetch jobs periodically.
    Using the Jobs API is much more complex, harder to implement and you won't have real time updates.

  <AlertDescription>
    We strongly recommend using our [webhooks](/docs/webhooks) to fetch jobs periodically. Using the Jobs API will
    make it harder to ensure fresh data and minimize API costs.
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

To integrate TheirStack's job data seamlessly into your application or database, focus on the following:

* [Ensure fresh data with efficient batching](#ensure-fresh-data-with-efficient-batching).
* [Minimize API costs by optimizing your requests](#minimize-api-costs-by-optimizing-your-requests).
* [Avoid missing any data during the integration process](#avoid-missing-any-data-during-the-integration-process).

### Ensure fresh data with efficient batching

We continuously monitor company websites and job boards to identify new job postings. To optimize performance, we recommend batching your requests with a maximum frequency of once every hour or two hours, based on your needs, and using the maximum limit of 500 jobs per page.

### Minimize API costs by optimizing your requests

One API Credit is consumed for each record returned from our API endpoints. If you fetch the same job multiple times, you will be charged for each fetch.

The `discovered_at` field in the `job` object indicates the date and time when the job was first identified by TheirStack. To prevent duplicate charges when fetching jobs, you can filter by `discovered_at_gte` in your request to get only new jobs. This parameter will ensure that only jobs discovered after the specified date are fetched.

The `discovered_at_gte` parameter is a timestamp in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` and it should be the date and time of the last job you fetched.

```sql
SELECT MAX(discovered_at) FROM jobs;
```

Copy the timestamp and use it as the value for `discovered_at_gte` in your request.

```bash
curl --request POST \
--url "https://api.theirstack.com/v1/jobs/search" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <api_key>" \
-d '{
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 500,
  "discovered_at_gte": "2024-12-29T17:32:28Z"
  "job_title_or": [
    "Data Engineer"
  ],
  "posted_at_max_age_days": 15,
  "job_country_code_or": [
    "NG"
  ],

}'

```

Another option is to use the `job_id_not` filter. You'd need to fetch the IDs of the jobs you already have in your system from us, and pass them to the Job Search Endpoint. This can be useful if you fetch jobs from multiple searches and the same job may appear in the results from more than one search.

### Avoid missing any data during the integration process

If your cron process fails‚Äîwhether due to system downtime, credit depletion, or connection issues‚Äîyou can resume from the last processed job using the `discovered_at_gte` parameter. This ensures you fetch only the jobs discovered after the last successful run, preventing any data loss even in periodic integrations.

title: How to find old jobs
description: Learn how to find old job postings from any company. Discover two methods: using our company lookup feature to see all jobs from a specific company, or performing a new job search and filtering by date. Old job postings can be a valuable source of information.
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/guides/how-to-find-old-jobs
---

Old job postings are a great source of information.

## How to Access to Old Job Postings

### How to find all jobs posted by a company

Use [company lookup](/en/docs/app/company-lookup) to search for a company and then click on "Jobs" to see all of them.

### Open a new job search filtering by date

Use [job search](/en/docs/app/job-search) to open a new job search and filter by date.

## Main use cases

A list of old job postings can be a valuable resource for several purposes, both for individuals and organizations. Here are some practical ways you can use such a list:

### Analyze Hiring Trends and Company Growth

* **Identify Hiring Patterns:** By reviewing old postings, you can spot when and how often companies hire for certain roles, helping to predict future hiring needs or business growth cycles.
* **Track Company Evolution:** Analyzing the types of positions and skills sought over time reveals how a company's structure, priorities, or technology stack have changed.

### Market and Technology Research

* **Map Technology Adoption:** Old job descriptions often list required tools, platforms, or programming languages, allowing you to chart the adoption of technologies across industries or regions.
* **Competitive Intelligence:** Understanding which companies have hired for specific skills or roles can inform your own business or career strategy.

### Lead Generation and Business Development

* **Sales Prospecting:** Historical job data can indicate which companies are expanding or investing in new areas, making them potential leads for B2B sales or recruiting services.
* **Identify Decision Makers:** Some job postings include contact information for hiring managers or department heads, useful for targeted outreach.

### Candidate and Recruitment Management

* **Repost or Duplicate Listings:** If you manage job postings, old listings can be quickly duplicated and updated to save time when hiring for similar roles again.
* **Manage Candidate Pipelines:** Even after a job expires, you can review applicants, move them through the hiring pipeline, or consider them for future opportunities.

### Personal Career Use

* **Interview Preparation:** If you've applied to a job that is now closed, reviewing the original posting helps you prepare for interviews by recalling the specific requirements and responsibilities.
* **Portfolio and Resume Tailoring:** Old postings can help you understand what skills and experiences are valued in your field, guiding you to tailor your resume or portfolio accordingly.

### Data Enrichment and Integration

* **Build Datasets:** Old job postings can be aggregated into datasets for machine learning, analytics, or integration into HR information systems.
* **API Integration:** Platforms like Mantiks allow you to extract historical job data in formats like CSV or JSON for further analysis or system integration.

import { ExternalLinkIcon } from 'lucide-react'

## Why job posting reveal buyer intent

Job postings serve as a transparent window into a company's current challenges and priorities. By analyzing these postings, you can uncover organizations in need of your offerings, allowing for timely and targeted outreach.

In order to identify companies with a strong intention, we could look for keywords that are related to the task your software automates or helps with.

## Matching Job Roles and Use Cases to Your Product's Value

For example, Qonto is a fintech company that provides expense management, bank, invoicing and billing, accounting and bookkeeping tools.

* When a company post a job looking for a "Bookkeeper" or "Accounting Manager", it means they have an increasing workload and need help with their accounting. If in the job description they mention "collect invoices and receipts", "expense report", "payroll processing", ... the chances that a software like Qonto that automates these tasks could help them are high.

* When a company post a job looking for "Finance Manager" or "Financial Analyst", it means they have an increasing workload and need help with their financial operations. If in the job description they mention "cash flow reporting", "financial analysis", "budgeting", ... the chances that a software like Qonto that automates these tasks could help them are high.

## Example Keyword Mapping by Product

Here's an example of how to map your product's use cases to relevant job keywords:

| Product               | Use cases                                         | Keywords to search in job descriptions                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Zapier (Automation)   | Workflow Automation, Integration, Task Automation | workflow automation, process automation, integration management, task automation, data synchronization, API integration, automation tools, workflow optimization, process improvement, efficiency tools |
| Notion (Productivity) | Project Management, Documentation, Knowledge Base | project management, documentation, knowledge base, team collaboration, task tracking, content management, wiki management, team workspace, productivity tools, workflow documentation                   |

The key is to identify the specific tasks and responsibilities that would indicate a company needs your product's functionality. Look for keywords that describe the problems your software solves or the manual processes it automates.

## Steps

    **Define a list keywords that represent tasks that your software automates or help with.**

## Introduction

Give me 3 minutes, and I'll show you how to outreach on autopilot to companies actively-hiring...

This is our 100% automated system that finds perfect clients for agencies & consultancies.

Most agencies waste time outreaching to prospects who don't need help right now.

But what if you could identify companies with:

* ACTIVE problems they're trying to solve
* BUDGET already allocated
* URGENCY to find a solution

That's exactly what our job board scanning system does.

## Steps

### 1. Set up job board scanning automations

We use TheirStack to monitor when companies post specific job listings:

* If you're a branding agency, target companies hiring graphic designers
* If you're a dev shop, look for companies hiring developers
* If you're a marketing agency, find brands hiring marketing reps

The logic is simple but powerful:

No company goes through the hassle of hiring unless they REALLY need help.

And the fact they're willing to hire shows budget is already approved.

This creates the perfect storm of need + resources + timing.

### 2. Use AI to find the right decision makers

Once we identify a company actively hiring, we:

* Automatically pull all potential decision makers from the company
* Use AI to determine who has actual buying power
* Find their exact contact details (both work and personal email)
* Get their phone numbers using tools like LeadMagic

The system delivers a daily feed of perfect prospects who are ACTIVELY looking to solve problems YOUR agency specialises in.

### 3. Create hyper-personalised outreach at scale

No more generic "hope you're doing well" messages:

* AI analyzes the exact job posting they've created
* Identifies the specific challenges they're trying to solve
* Crafts outreach that positions your agency as the solution
* Personalises each message based on the job description
* Automatically schedules and sends via SmartLeads & Lemlist

Your outreach essentially says:

"I see you're trying to hire for X, which means you're struggling with Y. Instead of spending months finding and training someone, we can solve this problem immediately."

## Why does this work?

* Target companies with ACTIVE needs (not cold prospects)
* Reach decision-makers when they're ACTIVELY seeking solutions
* Position your agency as the faster alternative to hiring
* Run everything on complete autopilot while you focus on clients
* Scale without adding sales staff or spending hours prospecting

## Without any of this:

* No more guessing which companies might need your services
* No more cold outreach to prospects who aren't actively buying
* No more spending hours researching contact details
* No more generic templates that get ignored

title: How to send a slack message for every new job found
description: Step-by-step guide to automatically notify your team in Slack whenever new jobs are posted using TheirStack's webhook integration with Make, Zapier, or N8n.
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/guides/how-to-send-jobs-to-slack

import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps'
import { Button } from '@/shared/ui/base/button'
import { ExternalLinkIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import Link from 'next/link'

Through our [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks) feature, you can trigger actions in any external system (CRMs, Slack, Airtable, etc).

Not all systems accept webhooks, so we recommend using workflow automation tools like [Make](https://www.make.com/), [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) or [N8n](https://n8n.io/) and then levearing their integrations libraries to connect to other systems like Salesforce, Hubspot, etc.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Choose a workflow automation tool to connect to TheirStack.**

    * [Make](https://www.make.com/) (Generous free plan, low cost)
    * [N8N](https://n8n.io/) (no free plan, open source, low cost)
    * [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) (Good documentation and easy for beginners)

    For this example we will use [Make](https://www.make.com/), it's our favorite and has a generous free plan. Follow this guides to do it in [N8n](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) or [Zapier](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/8496288690317-Trigger-Zaps-from-webhooks)
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Get the webhook URL from Make**

    * Click on "Create a new scenario"
    * Click on "Add Webhooks module"
      ![Add webhooks module](./make-add-webhook-module.png)
    * Click on "Custom webhook"
      ![Custom webhook](./make-custom-webhook.png)
    * Click on "Add" and then "Create webhook"
      ![Create webhook](./make-create-new-webhook.png)
    * Copy the webhook URL
      ![Webhook URL](./make-copy-webhook-url.png)
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Create a webhook that triggers an event when a new job is found**

    <Link href={'/en/docs/webhooks#how-to-set-up-a-webhook'} target="_blank">
      <Button>
        How to create a webhook in TheirStack <ExternalLinkIcon className="ml-2 w-4 h-4" />
      </Button>
    </Link>

    * Use the webhook URL you got from the previous step.
    * I recommend you sending a test event to make sure the webhook is working.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Add slack module to your Make scenario**

    * Click on "Add another module" and search for "Slack - Create message"

    ![Add slack module](./make-add-slack-module.png)

    * Configure in which channel you want to send the message and the message content.

title: Monitoring open jobs from current and past customers
description: How to know which companies from a given list are actively hiring. This can help SaaS companies detect new needs of their current customers for potential upsells, and also recruitment companies to find old customers that are hiring again and could be easier to sell to than if they were completely new customers.
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/guides/monitoring-open-jobs-from-current-and-past-customers
---

## The problem

**Are you a recruiting company?**

If so, you know it is a tough industry. Every month, revenue starts at zero dollars and you have to build up your way from there. Winning new customers is hard and you hear "no" many times. However, reconnecting with former clients can often be more straightforward and successful. They already know your work and trust you. TheirStack can help you make these reconnections easier by informing you when these past clients are hiring again.

**Are you a SaaS company?**

In this case, long-term, net retention revenue is key to building a long-standing, healthy, compounding business. If you have NRR > 100% it means that over time you're making more money from the same customers.

The way to do this is to figure out new problems your customers are having, and either build new products to solve them or help your customers solve them with your sofware in ways they weren't aware of.

By digging into their job posts, one can infer the problems a company is running into.

### Monitoring jobs manually

To monitor that for all your past customers, you'd have to

check all the job boards and all the companies' career pages

and do it regularly, at least weekly. Otherwise, jobs may already be filled, you could have lost them to a competitor or they could have solved their problem by the time you contact the company.

The bigger your customer list is, the longer this process would take. And you should check out all the jobs posted, until the last page.

Doing this manually is tedious and time-consuming.

Yet it's important and has to be done, or you risk leaving lots of money on the table on the table if you don't do it.

## Monitoring which companies are hiring

With TheirStack you can filter our worldwide jobs database by the company names and domains of your current or former clients, letting you:

* See the results visually on our UI
* Export the data in CSV and Excel
* Get alerts sent daily or weekly to your email with all the jobs and companies found
* Make the same searches via API
* Send new opportunities to Slack, Hubspot, Salesforce and many more with our Make and Zapier integrations.

TheirStack gives you 2 options or seeing the information

* **Doing a job search:** by searching our jobs database directly, you'll see all the details of each job, including the specific sections of the job description that are relevant to you (if you're filtering by technologies or keywords in the description). Check our Job Search guide to learn more about this, and some of the most important filters you can apply. To do this, go to the Jobs section, clicking on Jobs in the navbar

* **Doing a company search:** we'll group all the jobs from each company and just return a list of companies, with a small section where you can see some of the jobs found from each company.

In the rest of this guide, we'll show you how to do the second option. All the job filters are available in both views.

## Do a company search

To do so, follow these steps

1. Go to [app.theirstack.com](https://app.theirstack.com) and open a new company search
2. Remove the existing filters, by clicking on the X next to each filter.
3. Add a Company name filter, and then paste the names of all your past customers, one per line.
   ![Pasting company names](./pasting-company-names.gif)
4. Add a Job Posting -> Date Posted filter and set it to 30, for example, to see which of the companies have posted jobs in the last 30 days.
   ![Setting date filter](./adding-date-posted-filter.png)

As you see, a new Jobs column will be shown, where you can see the jobs each company has posted.

5. To get as many matches as possible, add a Company domain filter and paste the domains or URLs of your past customer. Sometimes the name of the company in our database doesn't match exactly the name that you pass, but the domain does. As you see, if you do this the number of companies for which we found jobs almost tripled (going from 68 to 176, out of 200 companies)

6. Save the search by clicking on the Save button in the top right corner of the screen and give a name to it by clicking on its name and setting a new one.

7. (Optional) If you specialize in tech jobs, you can also add a Job title filter and paste the jobs from this guide. You'll then only see the companies hiring tech profiles.

The Site may allow you to link your Third-Party Accounts.

We also use technologies such as cookies, JavaScript, local storage (as defined below), pixel tags, and scripts to collect information, provide a better user experience, and improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your Device. We may use ‚Äúpersistent cookies‚Äù to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service. We may use ‚Äúsession ID cookies‚Äù to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service, and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service. ‚ÄúLocal storage‚Äù is a way for a website to collect and store information ‚Äúlocally‚Äù (e.g., on the user‚Äôs device rather than on the website‚Äôs server) and then later retrieve it again. Local storage includes ‚ÄúlocalStorage‚Äù and ‚ÄúsessionStorage.‚Äù By using local storage, a user‚Äôs visits can, for example, be stored on their own computer, counted, and then given to us.

Any Licensed Materials that are downloaded and/or integrated into any CRM system must be maintained with identifying information indicating that such materials originated with TheirStack by, for example, maintaining a lead source of "TheirStack."

title: Pricing FAQs
description: Frequently asked questions about our pricing.
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/pricing-and-billing/faqs
---

## Why can't I see a company that was previously unblurred?

When you reveal a company, a company credit is used. This allows you to view all their jobs, technologies, and firmographics, or export that company as many times as you want for 90 days.

Since collecting new jobs or technologies incurs a cost, it's not feasible to offer unlimited access to new data indefinitely.

However, we are planning an enhancement to offer you a better experience: after 90 days, you will still be able to see the company, but any new jobs or technologies discovered after that period will not be accessible. This ensures you retain the data you've paid for, without receiving updates beyond the initial access period.

## How can I cancel my subscription?

You can cancel your subscription at any time. Please go to [this page](https://app.theirstack.com/settings/billing) and click on the "Cancel Subscription" button.

Once you complete the cancellation form, you will see that the status plan will be updated to "Cancelled".

## How can I set to auto recharge credits?

You can set to auto recharge credits at any time. Please go to [this page](https://app.theirstack.com/settings/billing) and click on the "Auto Recharge" button.

You can configure to auto-recharge when company credits or api credits are bellow a specific number(eg:1000 credits) and you can select the amount.

The cost of this credits package auto-charge will be the same credit prices as it was a recurren price. Check the [pricing here](https://www.theirstack.com/en/pricing)

## How can I update my subscription?

You can update your subscription at any time. Please go to [this page](https://app.theirstack.com/settings/billing) and click on the "Update Subscription" button.

When you update your subscription, the credits for the rest of the billing period won't be prorated. You will need to pay the full amount of the new plan.

## How to change my billing information?

You can change the billing information at any time: billing address, billing email, tax ID and phone number.

1. Go to [the billing page](https://app.theirstack.com/settings/billing)
2. Click on "Manage Billing" and you will be redirected to the Stripe billing portal.
3. Click on "Update information"
4. Update any of the fields: name, email, address, phone number and tax ID
5. Click on the "Save" button

The changes will be applied to the next invoice.

## How can I get a quote for purchasing a list of companies?

Our platform operates on a self-service model, which means we don't offer custom quotes for company lists. Instead, you can easily calculate the cost yourself:

1. Visit our [company search page](https://app.theirstack.com/search/companies/new) and use filters to find companies matching your criteria (e.g., technologies used, location, size).

2. Note the total number of companies in your filtered results (shown in the top left corner). This represents the number of company credits you'll need.

3. Check our [pricing page](https://www.theirstack.com/en/pricing) to find the plan that best fits your credit needs.

title: Find people
description: Finding email and phone number data with tools TheirStack integrates with
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/app/contact-data/find-people
---

TheirStack integrates natively with some of the bigger contact data providers, so finding emails and phone numbers from people working at the companies you can see on TheirStack is just a couple of clicks away.

Currently, we have integrations with Apollo, ContactOut, and LinkedIn (Free, Recruiter and Sales Navigator). Read along to learn more.

## Select companies to find people from

To find people with some of our 3rd-party integrations, select first on TheirStack the companies you want to find people from.

Whether you are on a job or a company search, you can select companies individually (by clicking on the checkboxes at the left side of the table) or in bulk, selecting hundreds of thousands of companies at once.

After having selected some companies, the three action buttons on top of the table will become clickable. When if you click on Find people you'll see all the platforms we integrate with.

![Find people](./find-people-button.png)

## Default roles that are looked for

When you click on any of the links to any of our integrations, a new tab will open filtering people by company on the tool you've clicked. By default, we also look only for some roles within those companies that are the typical decision-makers you'd want to reach, but this can vary by company size, market, etc, so you may want to change that.

Go to [https://app.theirstack.com/settings/integrations](https://app.theirstack.com/settings/integrations) to see the roles we look for by default:

If you always look for the same roles, if you change them here they will apply every time you use any of our integrations to always look for the same people.

![Default job titles](./default-job-titles.png)

## Contact data providers

### Apollo.io

Apollo provides emails and phone numbers for hundreds of millions of people from millions of companies worldwide. If you don't have an account, to use our integration you'll have to create one first.

Click on On Apollo and a new Apollo.io tab will open in your browser with the companies field pre-filled with the companies returned by TheirStack in the previous step

![Apollo.io](./apollo1.png)

Then, add the job title of the people in those companies you want to reach out to. For example, CTOs, in the Job Title section:

![Apollo.io](./apollo2.png)

Finally, select all the contacts you want, and then click on Save to get their contact data.

When you do that, a popup like this will appear where you can choose what to do with those contacts: get their phone numbers, export them as CSV, add them to a sequence on Apollo, etc‚Ä¶

Check out this guide from Apollo itself on how to export contacts in their platform.

### ContactOut

ContactOut is another powerful tool to find email and phone numbers. To use it, select it from the dropdown menu you get when clicking on Find people

You'll see something like this:

Highlighted in the picture, you'll see the areas of the screen where you can:

Change the roles of the ICPs you're looking for
Select one record at a time or all at once
Export data
Access the email or phone number of a specific person

![ContactOut](./contactout.png)

### LinkedIn Free

Any free LinkedIn account lets you search for people and filter by role and company. To use this, first select some companies and then click on Find People -> LinkedIn. You'll see the companies have already been pre-filled for you.

![LinkedIn Free](./linkedin-free1.png)

To filter by roles, click on Keywords -> Title and edit the default roles we pre-fill for you.

![LinkedIn Free](./linkedin-free2.png)

### LinkedIn Recruiter

The same process works for LinkedIn Recruiter. You'll need a paid account for this to work, and the process is the same. Select companies and then click on Find people -> LinkedIn Recruiter. We'll prefill the companies and the roles.

### LinkedIn Sales Navigator

Last, TheirStack also has a native integration with LinkedIn Sales Navigator. To use it, select some companies and then click on Find people -> LinkedIn Sales Navigator. You'll see something like this:

As you see, we also pre-fill the companies with the companies found before on TheirStack and the titles with the defaults. Change the titles manually here, or check out the section of this post "Default roles that are looked for" to set the same roles for all the integrations.

title: Hiring Manager
description: TheirStack provides the name, role and LinkedIn URL for the people in the hiring team for many jobs. Available via UI and API
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/app/contact-data/hiring-manager
---

For some markets, roles, and job boards, TheirStack is able to get the profile of the person that is posting the position.

![Hiring manager LinkedIn](./hiring-manager-linkedin.png)

In this example, LinkedIn shows you who this person is. We collect this data and make it available for many job posts:

![Hiring manager TheirStack](./hiring-manager-theirstack.png)

## Fields that we have

We collect the following fields for each the hiring team of each job:

* Name
* Role
* LinkedIn URL

And this is available via UI and API.

Note that in many cases this is just the recruiter that has posted the position and not the future manager of the hired person in the company. We do have that data in some cases as well - if you're interested, check this out.

## Seeing only jobs where the hiring manager is known

To do this, set the filter Has hiring manager -> Yes in the Job Search view on app.theirstack.com

![Has hiring manager filter](./has-hiring-manager-filter.png)

title: Contact data
description: Discover how TheirStack can assist you in obtaining personal contact data through our leading data partners or our hiring manager details
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/app/contact-data
---

We have direct integrations with top-tier third-party contact data providers such as Apollo.io, ContactOut, and LinkedIn [see this guide for more information](/en/docs/app/contact-data/find-people). Additionally, we offer [hiring manager information for applicable jobs](/en/docs/app/contact-data/hiring-manager), including the recruiter's name, position, and LinkedIn profile.

However, we do not supply contact data directly for several reasons:

* Rather than attempting to cover multiple areas, we focus on excelling in one‚Äîhelping you identify companies with strong purchasing intent. As a small company, we must choose our priorities wisely.
* Collecting and distributing personal contact data may not comply with GDPR regulations, despite being a common practice among many contact data providers.

title: Excluding recruiting agencies
description: Learn which filters can help you exclude jobs from recruiting agencies or consulting firms.
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/app/job-search/excluding-recruiting-agencies
---

If you‚Äôre a recruiting agency, it doesn‚Äôt make sense that you sell your services to other recruiting agencies. So you‚Äôd want to find only jobs from companies that aren‚Äôt recruiting agencies, or generate reports of companies that aren‚Äôt recruiting agencies . This article shows how to do it with TheirStack.

## Excluding by "Company type"

In the job search page, you will find a filter called "Company Type". It will let you search for jobs from direct employers or recruiting agencies.

![Company Type filter](./company-type-filter.png)

### A note on accuracy

Every classification task is a tradeoff between accuracy and precision. This is, maximizing the rate of true positives (% companies that we classify as recruiting agencies) while minimizing the rate of false negatives (% of companies that we classify as not recruiting agencies, but actually are).

We preferred to err on the side of caution, and try that all of the companies we classify as recruiting agencies actually are. This means some of them are left out, and will be classified as direct employers when they are not.

When you find some misclassified companies, contact us ([xoel@theirstack.com](mailto:xoel@theirstack.com)) and we‚Äôll fix that right away.

And to address it yourself, check out the next section.

### Refining results

As said in the previous section, there will be cases when recruiting companies are classified as direct employers. To reduce the times when this happens, you can add some filters

## Excluding by "Industry"

For a large percentage of companies, we have the industry they report they belong to.

You can use the Exclude companies filter in the Job Search or in the Technology Details views.

We classified all companies under industries that contain staffing and outsourcing as recruiting companies.

But many companies in the Human Resources industry will be recruiting companies. If you exclude that industry, you‚Äôll exclude those companies as well (you‚Äôll exclude also some companies that may not be recruiting agencies)

![Exclude companies filter](./industry-filter.png)

## Excluding by keywords in "Company Description"

If you only exclude companies by industry, you may still get some false positives: companies that are actually recruiting companies but label themselves as ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù or ‚ÄúInformation Technology & Services‚Äù.

However, for most companies we have a Company Description field (extracted from their websites, LinkedIn profile and other sources)

![Company description field](./company-modal-description.png)

And you can filter results by words or phrases present in the company description:

![Exclude Company Description Patterns filter](./company-description-filter.png)

Look for the Exclude Company Description Patterns filter. This field is case-insensitive.

## Excluding by "Company Name"

However, we know this all isn‚Äôt bulletproof and even if you do all of this, it‚Äôs likely that you still get some false positives, and results from companies you wouldn‚Äôt want.

So if you have a list of companies you don‚Äôt want to get results from, you can also pass it and TheirStack won‚Äôt return any results from companies that contain any of the strings you pass (so if you pass Apple, you also won‚Äôt get jobs from Apple, Inc.)

Look for the Exclude company names (substring match) field in the Companies section, on the right side.

You could even ask ChatGPT for a list like this

```

title: Job Search
description: How to find companies hiring by filtering through millions of listings worldwide. Discover how to refine your search using over 20 job and company filters, making it easier to target your ideal opportunities.
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/app/job-search
---

TheirStack is a sales tool designed to discover purchase intent signals through job postings. It helps SaaS companies, recruiting agencies, and consulting firms find their next customer by analyzing 40+ million job listings across 100+ countries.

We monitor more than 16 different sources, with a major proportion being derived directly from job boards and company career pages. By finding companies hiring for certain positions and mentioning certain keywords or technologies, you can identify companies with the problems that your company solves.

## Open a new job search

Go to your [app](https://app.theirstack.com) and click on "Search Jobs"

![New job search](./new-job-search.png)

You'll be taken to a screen like this. By default, the search that will run with the selected filters will return jobs found in the last 15 days in the country where you are. We'll explore some more useful filters below. To run the search, click on the big green button in the top right part of your screen that says Search.

After a couple of seconds, you should be able to see the last jobs posted for that specific search.

![Job search results](./job-search-results.png)

## Job preview

We store all historical information, so even if a job is expired in the job board where we found it, it will always be accessible via TheirStack.

To see the details about a job, click on the job title of any of the jobs found that appeared. For example:

![Job modal](./job-modal.png)

## Company preview

Similarly to how you see the details about a job, when you click on a company name a new modal will open displaying as much information we have about a company. In it, you can see data like their headcount, revenue per year, funding data and more in the Overview tab.

![Company modal](./company-modal.png)

### Company technologies

If you click on the Technologies tab, you will see a list of the companies we found and some details about each one, like the number of jobs where the company mentioned, when was the first and last time they mentioned it and more.

![Company modal technology tab](./company-modal-technology-tab.png)

### Company jobs

By clicking on the Jobs tab, a new tab will open in your windows where you'll see all the jobs posted by the company you were browsing before, all-time.

## Available filters

We let you filter jobs by attributes and company attributes. To see all attributes you can filter by, click on the Add filter button in the top left corner of your screen.

![Available filters](./available-filters.png)

You can type the name of an attribute and if it's possible to filter by it, the list of filters will show only the ones related to what you've typed.

Note that for some attributes, more than one operator is allowed. This lets you, for example, include and exclude data related to the same attribute.

### Job filters

#### Filter jobs by job title

The most basic kind of filter you could make is filtering by job title. By default, the filter operator that is selected when you filter by job title is the "contains any" filter. You can pass multiple job titles and our search engine will return jobs that match any of the job titles passed.

To pass multiple job titles, pass each one of them in a separate line (don't use commas to separate job titles!)

![Job title filter](./job-title-filter.png)

#### Exclude jobs by title

If you don't want to get jobs that include certain keywords, select the is not any of filter.

![Exclude jobs by title](./job-title-operators.png)

#### Filter by job description

Using the Job description filter, you can get jobs that match any of the words (or even regular expressions) that you pass. You can pass more than one, separated by line break. And you can also get jobs that don't match any of the words or patterns you pass if you select the filter type to be "not matches".

![Job description filter](./job-description-filter.png)

#### Filter jobs by technology

If you want to find jobs by technology, you have 2 options:

* Pass the technology name in the Job title filter.
* Use the Job technology filter.

Using the Job technology filter will look for jobs mentioning that technology in the description and will return more results than if you use the Job title filter. But if you use the Job title filter you'll get jobs where that technology is very relevant.

#### Filter jobs by country

To filter jobs by the country where they were posted, you can use the Job country filter. You can pass multiple countries here. If you select the is not any of operator, you can also exclude jobs from certain countries.

### Company filters

#### Filter jobs by company size

If you select the Company employees filter, you'll be able to get jobs from companies of only a specific size.

#### Filter jobs by industry

The Company industry lets you get jobs from companies that belong to a certain industry. If you select the is not any of operator, you can also exclude jobs from companies from certain industries.

#### Filter jobs by company name

If you want to include or exclude jobs from certain companies, this is also possible. Type "company" in the filter list and select Company name. Depending on the operator you choose, you can match company names totally or partially.

This could be useful if you want to manually exclude jobs from your competitors, for example.

#### Filter jobs by company description

You can pass a list of words to include or exclude jobs from companies that have these words in their descriptions. To do so, select the Company description filter and choose one of the operators.

#### Filter jobs by whether the company is the final employer or not

Most times, recruiting and staffing companies post jobs on behalf of others. Sometimes they set the industry right, but other times they don't, so if you just exclude jobs by industry you'll get some false positives.

We have classified all companies into 2 kinds: direct employers and recruiting companies, considering their industry but also patterns in their names and in their company descriptions.

To get jobs only from direct employers, choose the Company type filter and select Direct employer.

title: Data workflow
description: Steps we follow to source job data
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/data/job/data-workflow
---

import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps'

## How it works

To guarantee the highest possible quality of data, we follow this process:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Content acquisition

    We crawl different data sources every hour, such as job boards, ATSs, and company websites.

    * [Jobs from 16,000 different websites](/en/docs/data/job/sources)
    * [Data freshness](/en/docs/data/job/freshness)
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Extraction & Normalization

    For every job we collect, we extract key entities including the job posting, company, and, when available, the hiring manager.

    We also identify and extract technologies mentioned in the job title, description, and URL, then index them to enable filtering by tech stack.

    To ensure data quality and consistency across the platform, we normalize all extracted fields. For example:

    * Job descriptions are converted into standardized Markdown format.
    * Locations are structured into city, state, country, and other geographic components.
    * Job titles are cleaned to remove special characters and extra whitespace.
    * Company industries are harmonized across different data sources.

    Additionally, media assets such as company logos are downloaded and stored in our own infrastructure, allowing you to access them reliably via stable URLs for use in your own applications.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Job deduplication

    Most companies use an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to manage their hiring process. ATSs help streamline the candidate lifecycle, power career pages listing open roles, and sync job postings with major job boards like LinkedIn and Indeed.

    When a company posts a job through an ATS, it's common for that listing to appear on multiple job boards simultaneously. As a result, a single position may end up with 3‚Äì5 different references across various platforms. Additionally, job boards often scrape and repost listings from each other, further increasing duplication.

    Job posting deduplication is a crucial step to avoid having the same job posted multiple times in our database. If you use our data as sales signal, you wont' trigger the same signal multiple times. If you use our data to build a job board, you wont' have the same job posted multiple times.

    We apply both algorithmic techniques and manual checks to eliminate duplicates effectively.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Company enrichment

    Each time we collect a job posting, we also extract all available company information. However, in most cases, this initial data is quite limited‚Äîusually just the company‚Äôs name, logo, and domain. While useful as a starting point, this basic information isn't enough to deliver meaningful insights or enable advanced filtering.

    To unlock the full potential of our platform, we enrich these company records with a broader and deeper profile‚Äîa process we call company enrichment. This allows you to search, filter, and segment companies based on valuable attributes, helping you identify high-quality prospects faster and with greater precision.

    Our enrichment process adds the following data points to each company:

    * Industry ‚Äì Understand the market in which the company operates.
    * Company Size (Headcount) ‚Äì Target organizations based on their scale, from startups to large enterprises.
    * Estimated Revenue ‚Äì Gauge the financial size of a company to prioritize outreach.
    * Funding Details ‚Äì See how much capital the company has raised and from which investors.
    * Headquarters Location ‚Äì Identify geographic focus areas for your go-to-market strategy.
    * LinkedIn URL ‚Äì Access their LinkedIn profile for further context and contact discovery.
    * Website URL ‚Äì Navigate directly to the company‚Äôs official site.
    * Company Description ‚Äì Gain a quick overview of the company‚Äôs mission, products, or services.

    To ensure accuracy and broad coverage, we aggregate and validate this data from multiple trusted providers. While we strive for comprehensive enrichment, please note that coverage may vary depending on the availability of external data‚Äîsome fields may not be available for every company.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Quality Assurance

    Multiple data analysts monitor and verify data on a daily basis to ensure the data is of the highest quality.
  </Step>
</Steps>

title: Freshness & Scraping Frequency
description: Learn how often we update our tech job listings and company data to ensure you have access to the most current opportunities
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/data/job/freshness
---

## Real-Time Job Data Updates

At TheirStack, we maintain a sophisticated job scraping system that ensures you have access to the most current job postings. Our multi-tiered approach to data collection means you never miss out on relevant positions.

## Job Scraping Frequency

We use different scraping frequencies based on the source and volume of job postings:

* **Every 10 Minutes**: High-volume job boards and frequently updated company career pages
* **Every Hour**: Medium-traffic job sources with regular updates
* **Daily**: Smaller job boards and company websites with lower posting frequency

This tiered approach ensures that within 24 hours, we capture approximately 90% of all new tech job postings across our monitored sources.

## Job Discovery Timeline

The following visualization shows when we discover jobs posted on a specific date (April 24th):

![Tech job discovery timeline visualization](./data-freshness.gif)

As illustrated, while most jobs are discovered within the first 24 hours, our system continues to find additional positions over subsequent weeks. This means:

* Initial job counts for the current day may appear lower than final numbers
* Job discovery continues over time, increasing the total count
* You'll see the most comprehensive data after about 2-3 days

## FAQS

### Understanding delays in job discovery

When analyzing our data, you'll notice that a small percentage of jobs are discovered (`discovered_at`) after the day when they were initially posted (`posted_at`). This delay is common and is influenced by various factors beyond our control.

#### Discovery Timeline

To illustrate this, let's examine jobs posted on a specific day (December 14th) and observe when they were discovered by us.

![Jobs posted on December 12th](./chart2.png)

| Discovered At | Percentage of Jobs Discovered |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Same Day (0)  | 73%                           |
| Next Day (1)  | 21%                           |
| 2 Days Later  | 3%                            |
| 3 Days Later  | 0.3%                          |
| 4 Days Later  | 0.2%                          |

As shown, 73% of jobs are found on the same day they are posted. However, there is a significant number of jobs discovered days later. To understand this, it's important to know how we collect our data.

#### Factors Contributing to Delays

We scrape job boards, that at the same time scrape other job boards and career pages of companies. They also can get jobs posted directly by companies, or from companies‚Äô ATS systems that sync with these job boards.

While we scrape these job boards constantly, there are many reasons a job posted by a company at a certain date is not available on those job boards instantly, and therefore it‚Äôs not possible for us to discover it. To name a few:

* **ATSs sync delay with job boards**: The ATS that a company uses lets them sync jobs with a major job board, but the recruiter can choose which jobs to push to that job board because they charge for it. They may not initially sync it and do it after a few days to try to get more candidates. But the integration may keep the original date when the job was posted first, and show that in the final job board, instead of the date when the job was pushed. In this case, there will be a gap of a few days.

* **Job board scrapping delay**: A job board scrapes company career pages periodically, running daily. If a company posts a job at 14h and the job board scraper visits it at 10h every day, that job won‚Äôt be available in the job board until the day after. For companies that post many positions, it makes sense for job boards to visit those career pages with a high frequency. But visiting every career page of every company in the world periodically has a cost, so for smaller companies that very ocasionally post jobs, doing it on a weekly basis could help those job boards save money. So imagine they visit one of these companies‚Äô career site every Monday. If they post a job on Tuesday, they won‚Äôt visit it again until next Monday, so there will be a 6-day difference between `posted_at` and `discovered_at`

* **Job board publishing delay**: If someone publishes a job directly on a job board we scrape, this job board may also let them set a custom `posted_at` that is days before the current date. But the job is not available at that job board until the very moment when that person publishes it there, and even if the reported `posted_at` is previous to that, that job wouldn‚Äôt have been discovered before because that person hadn‚Äôt published it in that job board yet.

## FAQS: Frequently asked questions

### Why we don't allow to filter by job source?

These days, jobs typically originate in a company‚Äôs ATS, and the hiring manager then publishes them on platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor. As a result, a single job can appear in multiple places almost instantly.

We scrape multiple sources but only store each job once‚Äîthe first time we find it. So, if we discover a job on Greenhouse before it discovered on LinkedIn, the job in TheirStack won‚Äôt show LinkedIn as its source, even if it's also posted there.

That's why we don't recommend filtering by source, it's misleading.

### Why do I see a smaller number of job listings on TheirStack compared to platforms like Indeed or LinkedIn?

When you search for a job on Indeed or Linkedin, you may see more results than on TheirStack. This is because Indeed uses broader keyword matching, while TheirStack prioritizes precision.

The difference lies in how job searches are conducted on TheirStack versus platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, or Glassdoor. Let's focus on Indeed as an example, though the same principles apply to other providers.

#### Search methodology: Keyword matching

Job boards like Indeed use broader keyword matching:

* **Synonyms and Related Jobs**: For example, when you search for "network engineer," Indeed may return jobs that loosely match those terms, even if they don't contain the exact keywords.
* **Company Name Matching**: For example, when you search for "franchise", LinkedIn may return jobs where the company name contains the word 'franchise'.

On TheirStack, we prioritize precision. Our job title filter is deterministic, meaning it only returns results with an exact match for the keywords you provide. This approach ensures greater accuracy in the search results.

![Indeed job search](./indeed_job_search.png)

#### Search methodology: Date range

Indeed and LinkedIn typically display jobs that have been posted or reposted within the last 30 days by default, whereas TheirStack does not automatically filter jobs based on their reposted date.

#### How to Increase Results on TheirStack

* **Add More Keywords**: Broaden your search terms to include additional relevant keywords (see Picture A).

![Job title lists](./job_titles.png)

* **Use Regex Patterns**: Leverage regular expressions for more flexible and advanced search queries (see Picture B).

![Regex patterns](./job_titles_regex.png)

#### Upcoming Features

We're working on - a new filter that incorporates a synonym dictionary, which will enhance your search capabilities. - a new filter that allows you to filter by reposted date.

#### Avoid Filtering by Scraping Source

We scrape jobs from various sources, including company career pages, LinkedIn, and job boards. To avoid duplication, we save only the first instance of a job posting. For example, if a job appears on a company's career page and on Indeed, only the first source is stored.

Filtering by `scraping_source = Indeed` will return only jobs initially found on Indeed, which may reduce the results. We recommend using broader filters for a more comprehensive search.




---
title: Job status (active, closed)
description: 
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/data/job/status
---

## Is there anyway to get only active jobs?

Currently, we scrape all jobs only once. To be able to offer what you're asking for, we'd have to constantly be scraping millions of jobs every day for many days, which would increase our costs by 10x, 20x or even more. Those costs would have to be passed to customers, and no customers would be willing to pay for that.

So the best solution at the moment is that you check yourself for each job if they're active or not. You could use something like getting the markdown of the page with Firecrawl and then passing that to an LLM asking if the job is still active or not.

If you only want jobs that are likely to be still active, the more recent the jobs are, the more likely it'll be that they're still active. So another recommendation is to keep the range of dates you're passing to posted\_at filters recent, to something like the past 15 days.

title: How we source tech stack data
description: We infer technology usage from millions of jobs worldwide and give you some statistics on it.
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/data/technographic/how-we-source-tech-stack-data
---

## Infering tech stack data from job postings

We source our tech usage data from job postings. We gather job listings from millions of companies monthly by tracking company websites, job boards, and other hiring platforms.

When a job mentions a specific technology it hints the company is using that technology. The mention of the technology could be in the:

* **Title**: e.g. "Senior React Developer", "Java Developer", "Odoo Developer"...
* **Description**: e.g. "It requires experience with Hubspot", "We use GraphQL to query our data", "You have at least 3 years of experience with React"...
* **Job URL**: Jobs posted in a ATS have the domain of the ATS in the url. Eg: [https://join.com/companies/xxx/xxx](https://join.com/companies/xxx/xxx), [https://jobs.workable.com/view/xxx](https://jobs.workable.com/view/xxx)...

## Technology usage details

When you're in a [company search](https://app.theirstack.io/company/search) filtering by some technologies, we show cards highlighting the technologies they use that overlap with the ones you're filtering by.

![Technology confidence card](./technology-confidence-card.png)

If you hover on the technology card, you can see some details on the relationship between that company and that technology:

* **Confidence score (high, medium, low)** - see the full explanation [here](#the-confidence-score-measuring-the-likelihood-of-technology-usage)
* **First date found** - when a job by the company mentioned the technology for the first time
* **Last date found** - when a job by the company mentioned the technology for the last time
* **Rel. occurrence** - number of mentions of this technology compared to the total mentions of all the technologies from the same category. See the full list of categories here and browser the technologies we track here.
* **N. jobs mentioned** - number of jobs mentioning this technology, with link to those jobs
* Category this technology belongs to

By clicking on `N.jobs mentioned`, you'll be taken to a Job Search view showing the jobs from that company where the technology was found.

![Job search view](./jobs-using-technology.png)

## The confidence score: Measuring the likelihood of technology usage

Our Confidence Score (low, medium, high) helps us estimate how likely it is that a company actually uses this technology. It's calculated based on

* the number of mentions
* the frequency of the mentions relative to similar technologies in the category. If a company mentions 40 times Hubspot and 4 times Pipedrive, we consider it more likely they use Hubspot.
* where this mention is found. We give more weight to mentions in the title or in the url.
* the date of the mentions. We give more weight to the most recent mentions.

title: Technographic Data
description: Learn about the technographic data available in TheirStack.
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/data/technographic
---

We infer technology usage from millions of jobs worldwide. Our catalog of more than 21,000 technologies and 5M companies is the largest in the world.

* **Assured Accuracy**. For each technology identified, we assign a [confidence score](/en/docs/how-we-calculate-our-confidence-score) reflecting its data precision. This score incorporates variables such as the frequency of technology mentions in job listings, the recency of these mentions, the diversity of its usage across companies, and its prevalence within specific categories.

* **Transparency and Validation**. Gain direct access to our data sources. We facilitate verification by [linking directly to the job postings that reference the technology](/en/docs/how-we-source-tech-stack-data), alongside details about the posting company and the date. This ensures you can trust and validate the data's accuracy.

* **Always Up-to-Date**. Our platform receives new technographic signals every minute, ensuring you always have access to the latest data. [Data freshness](/en/docs/data-freshness) is at the core of what we do.
