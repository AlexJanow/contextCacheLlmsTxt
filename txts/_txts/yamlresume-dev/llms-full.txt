# YAMLResume: Resumes as Code in YAML

YAMLResume allows you to create and version control your resumes using YAML and
generate pixel perfect PDFs with professional layout and typesetting in a
breeze.

# CLI
URL: /docs/cli

***

## title: CLI

YAMLResume provides a CLI tool to help you manage your resume. You can follow
the [installation guide](/docs/getting-started#installation) to install it.

<Callout title="YAMLResume CLI in docker">
  Please note that we have a [docker image](/docs/installation#docker-users)
  for you, which has `yamlresume` CLI installed with all the necessary
  dependencies.

  For each sub-command in this guide, you can run it in docker by appending the
  sub-command after `yamlresume/yamlresume`.

  For example, to create a new resume in yamlresume CLI:

  ```sh
  yamlresume new my-resume.yml
  ```

  You can also run it in docker by:

  ```sh
  docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/yamlresume yamlresume/yamlresume new my-resume.yml
  ```
</Callout>

## JSON Resume

[JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org) is a pioneer in building a open standard
for a structured data format for resumes. Its first [official
release](https://jsonresume.org/blog/first-official-release) was in July 31,
2014, which is more than 10 years ago.

From its official website:

```markdown
## Origins and Conceptualization

JSON Resume was conceived as a solution to the fragmented and inconsistent
landscape of resume formats. Traditional resumes, typically created in formats
like Microsoft Word or PDF, often suffer from compatibility issues when parsed
by different systems. Recognizing this problem, Thomas Davis and Roland Sharp
initiated JSON Resume as an open-source project to create a universal,
machine-readable format for resumes.

## Development Milestones

The project began gaining momentum in the early 2010s, with significant
milestones such as the creation of the JSON Resume schema, the development of
the first CLI tools, and the establishment of the JSON Resume registry. These
milestones were driven by community contributions and the growing recognition of
the need for a standardized resume format in the tech industry.
```

JSON Resume did an excellent job in building a open standard for a structured
data format for resumes. However, it lacks some features that YAMLResume has.

YAMLResume is highly inspired by [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/), and
more opinionated in some aspects. For example, JSON Resumes says nothing about
how to convert the machine readable data to a beautiful, human-readable resume.

Here are some notable differences:

| Feature            | YAMLResume            | JSON Resume         |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Data Format        | YAML                  | JSON                |
| Data Structure     | All top-level objects | Some nested objects |
| Typesetting Engine | LaTeX                 | None                |
| Layout Spec        | Built-in              | Not specified       |
| Rich Text Support  | Yes                   | No                  |

We are going to offer a tool to import JSON Resume to YAMLResume in the future.

## Introduction

Creating a resume may not be difficult, but it is definitely a boring, lengthy
and tedious process.

With YAMLResume, you can create and version control your resumes with YAML and
create pixel perfect PDFs with professional layout and typesetting in a breeze.

YAMLResume is the core engine of [PPResume](https://ppresume.com), a LaTeX based
builder. It has helped [thousands of
people](https://blog.ppresume.com/posts/2024-recap) around the world create
pixel perfect, professional looking resumes and land their dream jobs. Here we
decided to open source the engine, in order to give people the right and freedom
to say [no to vendor lock-in](https://blog.ppresume.com/posts/no-vendor-lock-in)

![YAMLResume New and Build Resume](./static/images/yamlresume-new-and-build.webp)

## Getting Started

### Docker Users

If you are a docker user, you are in luck, we have a [docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/yamlresume/yamlresume) for you, which has
[yamlresume cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yamlresume) installed with all
its dependencies, such as [XeTeX](https://www.tug.org/xetex/) and some
[recommended fonts](/docs/installation#font).

You can just create a new resume with the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/yamlresume yamlresume/yamlresume new my-resume.yml
```

Edit `my-resume.yml` accordingly and then build the resume from yaml to pdf:

```sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/yamlresume yamlresume/yamlresume build my-resume.yml
```

### macOS Users

Let's assume that you're using macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as the
package manager. If you are not, please see the
[Installation](/docs/installation) guide for detailed instructions for your
operating system.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    #### Install Node.js

    You need to [install
    Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/all#macos) 20.x or
    newer.

    ```sh
    brew install node
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Install Typesetting Engine

    YAMLResume needs a [typesetting
    engine](/docs/getting-started#typesetting-engine) to generate PDF. Currently it
    supports two typesetting engines:

    * [XeTeX](/docs/getting-started#xetex)
    * [Tectonic](/docs/getting-started#tectonic)

    <Tabs groupId="typesetting-engine" persist items={["XeTeX", "Tectonic"]}>
      ```sh tab="XeTeX"
      brew install mactex
      ```

      ```sh tab="Tectonic"
      brew install tectonic
      ```
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Install YAMLResume

    Installing `yamlresume` is a breeze. You can install it using your favourite
    Node.js package manager:

    <Tabs groupId="package-manager" persist items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
      ```sh tab="npm"
      npm install -g yamlresume
      ```

      ```sh tab="pnpm"
      pnpm add -g yamlresume
      ```

      ```sh tab="yarn"
      yarn global add yamlresume
      ```

      ```console tab="bun"
      bun add -g yamlresume
      ```
    </Tabs>

    Verify `yamlresume` is installed successfully:

    ```console
    $ yamlresume help
    Usage: yamlresume [options] [command]

    YAMLResume — Resume as Code in YAML

     __   __ _    __  __ _     ____
     \ \ / // \  |  \/  | |   |  _ \ ___  ___ _   _ ___  ___   ___
      \ V // _ \ | |\/| | |   | |_) / _ \/ __| | | / _ \/ _ \ / _ \
       | |/ ___ \| |  | | |___|  _ <  __/\__ \ |_| | | | | | |  __/

    Options:
      -V, --version             output the version number
      -v, --verbose             verbose output
      -h, --help                display help for command

    Commands:
      new [filename]            create a new resume
      build [options] <source>  build a resume to LaTeX and PDF
      languages                 i18n and l10n support
      templates                 manage resume templates
      help [command]            display help for command
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### \[Optional] Install Fonts

    ##### Linux Libertine Font

    We also recommend installing the [Linux
    Libertine font](/docs/getting-started#linux-libertine) for the best looking PDF
    output, but this is optional.

    ```sh
    brew install font-linux-libertine
    ```

    ##### Noto Fonts

    If you need to create a CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) resume, we recommend
    that you install the [Noto font](https://fonts.google.com/noto):

    ```sh
    brew install font-noto-sans-cjk font-noto-serif-cjk
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Create Your First YAML Resume

    OK, we have everything ready, we can now create a yaml resume now with
    `yamlresume new`:

    ```console
    $ yamlresume new my-resume.yml
    ✔ Created my-resume.yml successfully.
    ```

    Edit `resume.yml` accordingly, then you can generate a PDF with `yamlresume
    build`:

    ```console
    $ yamlresume build my-resume.yml
    ◐ Generating resume PDF file with command: xelatex -halt-on-error my-resume.tex...
    ✔ Generated resumep PDF file successfully.
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## title: Installation

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';

YAMLResume is a Node.js tool, under the hood, it transform your resumes from the
YAML format to LaTeX code and then call a LaTeX typesetting engine to compile
the generated LaTeX code to PDF. Besides, to get optimal PDF output, we also
suggest to install some fonts. In a nutshell, you need to install the followings
to get started with YAMLResume:

* Node.js
* [yamlresume package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yamlresume)
* a typesetting engine
* \[optional] some fonts

This sounds a bit complicated, but don't worry, we have your back.

## Docker Users

If you are a docker user, you are in luck, we have a [docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/yamlresume/yamlresume) for you. This image has
everything pre-packaged, including:

* [Node.js](/docs/installation#nodejs)
* [yamlresume CLI](/docs/installation#yamlresume)
* [XeTeX](/docs/installation#xetex)
* [some recommended fonts](/docs/installation#font)

You can create a new resume instantly with the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/yamlresume yamlresume/yamlresume new my-resume.yml
```

<Callout title="How does this docker magic work?">
  This command will create a new resume called `my-resume.yml` in your current
  directory. Steps:

  1. `docker run ... yamlresume/yamlresume` - runs a new container from the
     `yamlresume/yamlresume` image, if this image is not existed in your local
     machine, it will pull it from the [docker
     hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/yamlresume/yamlresume).
  2. `--rm` - automatically removes the container when it exits
  3. `-v $(pwd):/home/yamlresume` - mounts the current directory (`$(pwd)`) into
     the container at `/home/yamlresume`, allowing the container to access local
     files
  4. `new my-resume.yml` - run yamlresume CLI [new](/docs/cli#new) sub-command to
     create a new resume with the filename `my-resume.yml`
</Callout>

Edit `my-resume.yml` accordingly and then build the resume from yaml to pdf:

```sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/yamlresume yamlresume/yamlresume build my-resume.yml
```

Basically, you can call all of the `yamlresume` [CLI sub-commands](/cli) in this
way—just append the sub-command after `yamlresume/yamlresume` and then follow
the corresponding usage guide.

The `-v` flag here is quite important here because it mounts the current
directory (`$(pwd)`) into the container at `/home/yamlresume`, allowing a two
way file sync between the local directory and the container.

<Callout title="Github Mirror">
  If you have trouble to pull down `yamlresume/yamlresume` image from [docker
  hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/yamlresume/yamlresume), don't worry, we have a
  [github mirror](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/pkgs/container/yamlresume)

## Non-Docker Users

If you are not a docker user, please follow the appropriate instructions below
to install yamlresume CLI and all the necessary dependencies based on your
operating system. At the time of writing, our guide covers macOS, Windows, and
some Linux distros (Ubuntu and and RHEL based distros).

### Node.js

Node.js 20.x or newer is required.

<Callout title="Why Node.js 20.x or newer?">
  Theoretically `yamlresume` should work with Node.js 18, however it is highly
  recommended to use Node.js 20 or newer because Node.js 18 LTS is scheduled to
  reach End-of-Life on [30 April
  2025](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v18.20.8).

### Typesetting Engine

Under the hood, `yamlresume` does the job of a compiler, parsing a YAML resume
to an
[AST](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/main/packages/core/src/compiler/ast.ts)
and then [transforming the AST to LaTeX
code](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/main/packages/core/src/compiler/codegen/latex.ts).

As a mini-compiler, `yamlresume` relies on a typesetting engine to compile the
generated LaTeX code to PDFs. Therefore you must first install a typesetting
engine first before you can use `yamlresume` to generate resume PDFs.

YAMLResume currently supports two typesetting engines: [XeTeX](#xetex) and
[Tectonic](#tectonic).

<Callout title="Why LaTeX?">
  At the time of writing, [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is still the
  best choice of typesetting engine for producing professional looking PDFs.
  [Typst](https://typst.app/) is a great alternative, but it is still in its
  early stage and its CJK support is not mature and production ready yet.
  Previously I wrote a post [On Typesetting
  Engines](https://blog.ppresume.com/posts/on-typesetting-engines) explaining
  the reasons why I chose LaTeX over other typesetting engines when I founded
  [PPResume](https://ppresume.com).
</Callout>

#### XeTeX

[XeTeX](https://tug.org/xetex/) is a [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX)
typesetting engine using [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) and
supporting modern font technologies such as
[OpenType](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType),
[Graphite](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/graphite) and [Apple Advanced
Typography (AAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Advanced_Typography).

It is a very mature, stable typesetting engine that is widely used by many
academic and scientific people.

#### Tectonic

[Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io) is a modernized, complete,
self-contained
[TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX)/[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
engine, powered by [XeTeX](https://tug.org/xetex/) and
[TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/).

A full TeX Live distribution typically takes up several GB of disk space, while
tectonic's initial installation takes up only 10+ MB. It automatically downloads
support files, so you don't have to install a complete LaTeX distribution. When
you start using a new LaTeX package, Tectonic simply downloads the files it
needs and continues processing.

Tectonic provides an official [installation
guide](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/install.html), but this
would just put tectonic in the directory where you ran the installation command,
`yamlresume` needs a global `tectonic` command in your `$PATH`, so you need to
figure that out with some shell hacks on your own.

If you're a macOS user, you're in luck because Homebrew provides prebuilt
package:

```sh
brew install tectonic
```

In to my experience, tectonic still has some minor compatibility issues with
official XeTeX, so if you do not mind the long download tim eof a full TeX Live
distribution, XeTeX is still the recommended choice here.

## title: Font

If text is the vehicle for the transmission of information, then the visual
characteristics of the text itself—that is, the font—influence the quality of
the message.

In principle, the typesetting of a resume should be concise and clear. As for
font, first you should never use fonts that are too fancy, second the types of
fonts should not be too many—best limited in three. Here we will discuss some
basics of fonts and main points in typesetting.

## Font classification

### Serif vs. sans-serif

In terms of serifs, fonts for Latin alphabet are divided into two families:
serif and sans-serif[^1].

A serif is a tiny line attached to the end of a stroke in a letter. A font with
serifs is called serif font, or serifed font. In contrast, a font without serifs
is called sans-serif font, where *sans* is the French word for "without".

![Sans serif](./static/images/1280px-Serif_and_sans-serif_01.svg.webp)

![Serif fonts](./static/images/1280px-Serif_and_sans-serif_02.svg.webp)

![Serifs for serif fonts (red)](./static/images/1280px-Serif_and_sans-serif_03.svg.webp)

### Proportional vs. monospaced

According to whether or not the widths of letters are the same, fonts can be
divided into monospaced and proportional. As the name suggests, all letters in a
monospaced font occupy the same amount of horizontal space, while in a
proportional font they don't.

![Proportional fonts and monospaced fonts](./static/images/1280px-Propvsmono.svg.webp)

In traditional printing, proportional fonts can improve the legibility of words.
Due to technical limitations, the early computers and typewriters can not adjust
the widths of letters . So all characters are made into the same width, thus
monospaced fonts come into being. With the improvement of computer technology,
the GUI (Graphical User Interface) has become the mainstream and been developing
continuously, technical limitations no longer exist, so proportional fonts have
become quite popular, since they are more naturally legible for human.

### CJK Font

Font styles in [CJK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters) is a bit
complicated. Generally speaking, there're also serif and sans-serif fonts in CJK
languages.

#### Song

**[Song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_typefaces)**: known as 宋体/明体 in
Simplified Chinese, 宋體/明體 in Traditional Chinese, みんちょうたい/明朝体 in Japanese,
명조체/明朝體 in Korean, is the serif font in CJK.

Song is usually used for body text, headings and notes. When used for headings,
the weight of the characters is often increased to differentiate them from the
body text. Currently it is the most common used font in printing.

#### Bold

**[Bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif)**, known as 黑体 in Simplified
Chinese, 黑體 in Traditional Chinese, is the sans-serif font in CJK.

Bold is often used for headlines, introductions, logos, etc. Bold is also used
in body text to emphasize specific words. Due to the large number of strokes in
Chinese characters and the poor clarity of bold in small characters, traditional
printing rarely uses bold as the body text; however, with the refinement of
character creation technology, coupled with the development of the Internet and
digital publishing, many bold fonts have been developed for body text, and a
small number of books have begun to use bold as the body text font.

Besides Song and Bold, *Chinese also has two additional font styles that are
widely used*.

#### Regular

**[Regular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_script)**: known as 楷体 in
Simplified Chinese, 楷體 in Traditional Chinese, is the most common style used in
modern Chinese writings.

Regular are mainly used for headings, introductions, dialogues, summaries and
other paragraphs that are different from the main text. However, regular are
less frequently used for emphasis because of their proximity to Song.

#### Fangsong

**[Fangsong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fangsong)**, known as 仿宋体 in
Simplified Chinese, 仿宋體 in Traditional Chinese, is a type of regular script
typeface. It is mostly used in the introduction, summary and other paragraphs
that are different from the main text. Meanwhile, it is also the standard font
used in official documents produced by the Chinese government.

## Font design and usage

Digital publishing has been developing for many years, and western lanauges has
a very small character set, so there are many kinds of fonts designed by
different people with various demands.

For a monospaced font, the main focus is on the design of each single letter,
other than that, in a proportional font, the space between letters should also
be seriously considered.

### Letter composition

Letters in every font have a consistent structure, font users are supposed to
know these basic concepts:

* baseline: the invisible line on which "H" or "n" stands
* cap height: the distance from baseline to the top of a linear uppercase letter
  like "H" or "E"
* x-height: the distance from the bottom to the top of lowercase "x"
* ascender: the ascending parts of lowercase letters like "b", "d", "f", "h",
  "k", "l" over the top of "x" , its height is called the ascender height, the top
  line which ascenders align is called the ascender line
* descender: the descending parts of lowercase letters like "g", "j", "p", "q",
  "y" below the baseline, its height is called the descender height, the bottom
  line which descenders align is called the descender line

![Typography](./static/images/2000px-Typography_line_terms_alternate.svg.webp)

### Letter-spacing

Letter-spacing, or tracking, refers to the space between letters.
Letter-spacing adjustment is divided into font designers' side and font users'
side; it affects the density in a line or block of text.

For font designers, the adjustment of letter-spacing is an important procedure
in designing. In a proportional font, the spacing on the left side of a single
letter is not necessarily the same as on the right side. The purpose is to
ensure legibility when the letter is next to whatever other letters on both
sides.

For font users, the adjustment of letter-spacing means manually rearranging the
space between letters by software after the original typesetting, in order to
obtain special alignment[^2], or a better layout effect[^3].

### Kerning

Kerning refers to the process of increasing or decreasing the space between
specific letter pairs in a proportional font. These pairs of letters are called
kerning pairs. Kerning is more concerned about the visual spacing rather than
the actual spacing.

Designers of many fonts will pay attention to kerning pairs while designing, and
store kerning adjustment values in the font file. In this way, typesetting
software can automatically adjust spacing for kerning pairs according to the
values, thus produce a better layout effect.

Every letter has a unique shape, so during the design and implementation of a
font, letters in all kerning pairs must cooperate to produce the best visual
effect. In fact, this is where the key procedure and difficulties lie[^4].

![Kerning](./static/images/1280px-Kerning_EN.svg.webp)

### Ligature

A ligature is a glyph that joins two or more letters together.

Ligatures in print originate from hyphenated characters in handwriting. After
the birth of movable-type printing, many ligatures were directly made into type.
However, after the widespread use of sans-serif fonts in the 1950s and
phototypesetting in the 1970s, the use of block letters became rare. The
earliest digital typesetting software that could use ligatures for digital
typesetting is TeX created by [Donald
Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth). This trend also affected the
desktop publishing after 1985. In early times, software could not replace
letters with ligatures (but TeX could), and most of the newly made fonts for
computers did not include ligatures. Furthermore, in the early days of personal
computers, most of the computers were in English, and there was no practical
need for the use of ligature, as it was not mandatory to use it in the English
language. With the development of digital typesetting technology such as
[OpenType](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType), ligatures have
gradually returned to practice[^5].

In normal day-to-day business documents, the lack of ligatures is not treated as
spelling error, but for professional typesetting in advertising, book publishing
and other fields, ligatures are essentially required.

![Ligature](./static/images/1106px-Ligatures.svg.webp)

### Italics

Italic is a font style achieved by tilting the font on top of the normal font
style; it can refer to italic type or oblique type[^6].

There are two types of tilted fonts in western font: oblique type and italic
type. The one that is tilted with a change in the shape of the characters is
"Italic Type", while the one that simply tilts the original font to the right
without a change in the shape of the characters is known as oblique type. Since
oblique italics, which are simply tilted and distorted by software algorithms,
have loose strokes, more and more designs have recently favored the use of newly
designed, specialized italic types.

Theoretically, italics include italic type and oblique type, but it should be
noticed that actually not all italic type are slanted .

In practice, italics are usually applied to one piece of text to emphasize or
distinguish it from the main body that is in serif fonts.

### Old style numbers

Old style numbers, also known as [text
figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_figures), designed with varying
heights for latin script languages in a fashion that resembles a typical line of
running text, hence the name.

![Text Figures](./static/images/440px-Text_figures.jpg)

In contrast, lining style numbers (also called lining, titling or modern
figures), have the same height as upper-case characters.

YAMLResume defaults to old style numbers for latin script language resumes and
lining style numbers for others.

> High-quality typesetting generally prefers text figures in body text: they
> integrate better with lowercase letters and small capitals, unlike runs of
> lining figures. Lining figures are called for in all-capitals settings (hence
> the alternative name titling figures), and may work better in tables and
> spreadsheets.
>

### Recommended Western Font

There are tons of fonts out there nowadays, so recommending a universal western
font scheme for your resume is not an easy task.

* RECOMMEND, using serif fonts for the main body text
* RECOMMEND, using sans-serif fonts for titles, but serif fonts can be used as
  well
* RECOMMEND, using italic font style to emphasize text in main body,
  corresponding bold style can be used as well

Here is a list of commonly used serif fonts:

* [Garamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garamond)
* [Palatino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatino)
* [Geogria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_\(typeface\))
* [Baskerville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baskerville)

[^1]: [Serif vs Sans: The Final Battle](http://designreviver.com/inspiration/serif-vs-sans-the-final-battle/)

[^2]: When the width of layout is small, usually it's not suitable to
    use justified alignment, because applying justified alignment will

## title: Grammar

## Content

Being concise is the most important for a resume. Basic objective information is
the core of a resume:

* personal information
  * important contact information such as telephone, e-mail must be clear
* education backgrounds
  * if you are a fresh graduate, you can add education background of high school
* professional skills
* awards
* work (internship) experiences

Be cautious to add subjective information:

* self-evaluation
* personal hobbies
* social activities, volunteer experiences, etc., which have no clear
  relations with the applied position

Be cautious to add objective information that are unrelated with the applied
position:

* photos
* birthday
* home address
* nationality
* political identity
* marital and family status

Prohibited contents:

* "My Resume" as the title
* watermarks of logos on resume templates from different sources

## Spelling

Spelling errors in a resume are a big no-no in a job search. Too many elementary
spelling errors can affect an employer's first impression of an applicant. Most
software have a spell checker, so use it appropriately to avoid many primary
spelling errors. Of course, don't rely too much on the software's spelling
check, it's better to find a trusted friend for a proof-reading.

### Proper nouns

In addition to common spelling errors, there are highly frequent spelling errors
in proper nouns, because they are more case sensitive. The same combination of
letters with different capitalization may have completely different meanings in
various fields, so job seekers must be very cautious. For example,
[iOS](http://www.apple.com/ios/) with lowercase "i" represents the mobile
operating system on an Apple iPhone, while
[IOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_IOS) with uppercase "I" is the
dedicated system on Cisco routers.

Limited to our background, this guide summarizes some common spelling errors of
proper nouns within the IT field.

## Syntax

Compared with ordinary writing, there are some special grammar requirements for
resume writing.

* generally use the past tense, but If you are describing the present work or
  education experience, use the present tense
* generally begin an item with a verb in the past tense, omitting the subject
* try to use simple and short sentences that are easy to understand, instead of
  long and complex clauses
* list education backgrounds and work experiences in flashbacks, and the time
  format should be accurate to month
* use the standard time format like "2015.05", or format that can be definitely
  interpreted, such as "June, 2016", instead of year abbreviations like "05/06",
  which can be interpreted differently in different countries

Here a list of 100 commonly used words in past tense in resume writing:

|               |              |              |              |              |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |

## A Guide for Resume Writing and Typesetting

A resume gives people a first impression of your career.

On an A4 sheet paper (210 mm \* 297 mm), a resume ends the previous stage of
your life and begins the next.

> A nine-storey tower arises from a pile of earth.
>
> — [Laozi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi), Chapter 64

A pretty-print resume is based on details such as font, punctuation, layout
and grammar.

This guide systematically explains the essentials of resume writing and
typesetting with special emphasis on typography, helping you to make a resume
beautiful in form and spirit. For each topic, it first explains WHAT it is, then
WHY it is so, and finally HOW to do it.

The guide tries to be as concise and clear as possible, there are four priority
levels for the different explanations:

* **MUST**, mandatory in typesetting, serious mistake if violated
* **RECOMMEND**, conform to general typesetting standards, highly recommended
* **SHOULD NOT**, require advanced knowledge or features in typesetting, or diverse
  in different languages and cultures, or vary with regulations in companies,
  dangerous to use if not informed
* **MUST NOT**, conflict with general typesetting standards, forbidden to apply


# Publishing

## title: Publishing

## File format

Common file formats for resumes include:

* PDF
* Microsoft Word (doc, docx)
* Plain Text
* HTML

Here we recommend PDF most:

* PDF has excellent cross-platform output quality, ensuring nearly 100%
  consistent printing and display
* PDF can be embedded with fonts, allowing great freedom in font selection
* default PDF reader available on most platforms
  * Windows 8 and above have a built-in PDF reader
  * macOS has
    [Preview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preview_\(Mac_OS\)), iOS
    has [iBooks](http://www.apple.com/ibooks/)
  * many browsers (such as Chrome) have built-in
    [pdf.js](http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/), which can also open PDF by default

It's easier to learn MS Word, but delivering a resume with Word format has great
disadvantages:

* Word documents must be opened with additional office software
  installed
  * Microsoft Word, [WPS Office](https://wps.com) for Windows
  * [iWork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWork) for macOS
  * [WPS Office](https://wps.com), [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)
    for Linux
  * many online document editing systems such as [Google
    Docs](https://docs.google.com/) can also open and edit Word documents
* Word documents may display quite differently in different software on
  different platforms
  * in reality not everyone has installed [Microsoft
    Word](https://products.office.com/en-us/word) on his computer
  * another fact is that a genuine license for Microsoft Word may cost hundreds
    of dollars
* in order to try to ensure consistent display and output, Word documents are
  best used with only a few fonts that are common to the major operating systems,
  which results in Word documents with very little freedom in font selection.

Of course, different HR managers in various companies can have different
requirements and preferences. We recommend that you export the resume to PDF as
an alternative if making it by Word

## Email etiquette

Aside from the company's proprietary recruiting system, the primary method of
submitting resumes for job applications should be email. Some basic e-mail
etiquette is as follows.

* set the correct email nickname, don't use informal overly fancy nicknames, it
  will give the employer an impression of being very unprofessional
* use a uniform format in the email header, keep it clear and concise to convey
  the most important information
  * recommended format: `Apply-Company Position-Name-[University/Education]-[Work Experience]`
* the body of the email should be concise, it is not recommended to write a long
  cover letter with a lot of personal subjective evaluation
  * best to add the title and a greeting at the beginning of text
  * contents in body
    * basic personal information, such as work status (in-service or not),
      position, education and work experiences, etc.
    * applying position
    * applying approach, whether recommended by others
  * add an inscriber containing name and contact information (telephone/email)
* attach the resume file named with the same format of the header


# Punctuations
URL: /docs/guide/punctuations

***

## title: Punctuations

Punctuation is the most inconspicuous but also most error-prone part in resume
writing. Whether or not you can use punctuation correctly and standardized
reflects the job seeker's attitude to apply for the job.

The correct and standardized use of punctuation may look easy, but it is not as
simple as it seems. The main reason is that different language environments
either do not have a clear specification for the use of punctuation, or have a
specification but many places are not clearly defined, or there are several sets
of [style guides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide) but they are
incompatible or even conflicting with each other; and secondly, the actual
typesetting often encounters the situation of multi-language mixing, and then
the problem will become even more complicated. This guide tries to summarize
some general rules for the use of punctuation for your reference.

* MUST, adding one space after commas, periods, semicolons, colons, exclamation
  marks and question marks
* MUST, adding one space before an open bracket and after a closed bracket, same
  as a word, but no space after a closed bracket followed by a comma
* RECOMMEND, adding one space between a number and its unit
* RECOMMEND, not adding spaces around a hyphen, sometimes necessary to fine-tune
  the letter-spacing
* RECOMMEND, not adding spaces around a slash which locates two parallel things
  like "A or B"
* RECOMMEND, using quotation marks (`‘`、`’`、`“`、`”`), instead of
  [apostrophes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe)
* SHOULD NOT, adding any punctuation mark at the end of items in a [Bullet
  list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_\(typography\))
* MUST NOT, hanging a punctuation mark at the start of a line, which can be
  avoided by software's automatic settings or manual adjustment

## Connective mark

Hyphen (-), en-dash (–), and em-dash (—) are three punctuation marks that can be
easily confused and lead to errors. The usage of them is described below.

> for a hyphen, type a hyphen (-);
>
> for an en-dash, type two hyphens (--);
>
> for an em-dash, type three hyphens (---);
>
> for a minus sign, type a hyphen in mathematics mode ($-$).
>
> — Donald Knuth, [The TeXBook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers_and_Typesetting)

### Hyphen (-)

The hyphen is used primarily for:

* compound words such as "upper-case letter"
* separating numbers or characters, such as telephone numbers, "1-888-777-666"
* hyphenating the word at the end of a line to keep the whole layout neat

There are a few rules about hyphenation at the end of a line:

* try not to hyphenate the last word in more than three continuous lines
* avoid dividing proper nouns, personal names, etc.
* avoid cross-page hyphenation
* segment words according to syllables in principle, however the position to
  hyphenate varies with words, so it's better to check dictionaries if
  necessary[^7]

### En-dash (–)

The length of an en-dash equals the width of uppercase "N", and is half of the
length of an em-dash. It's mainly used for:

* indicating a range of numbers, date time, etc. such as dates in a year, "July–August 1968"
* indicating the start and end points of the navigation path, such as
  "Boston–Hartford route"

When using an en-dash, it is generally not necessary to add spaces around it.

### Em-dash (—)

The length of an em-dash equals the width of uppercase "M", and its usage is the
most flexible and complex. It is usually used for:

* explaining something in details, equivalent to parentheses or colons
* segmenting declarative clauses
* indicating that the conversation is interrupted, in which case an
  ellipsis may also be used

In addition, there are situations where two or three em-dashes are joined
together, but I won't go into details here.[^8].

***

[^7]: Professional typesetting software generally have automatic
    hyphenating function, to some extents it can locate the position for
    hyphenation if turned on, but it's best to artificially check
    again.

[^8]: [Wikipedia/Dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash) demonstrates detailed
    usage of this symbol and the input methods of it on different operating
    systems.


# Typesetting
URL: /docs/guide/typesetting

***

## title: Typesetting

Typesetting is "architecture in two dimensions."

If text and its fonts are the materials of the building, then typesetting is
the drawings of the building. Before discussing typesetting, we need to clarify
some basic concepts, especially the system of dimensional units commonly used in
typesetting.

## Font size

Font size is the standard measurement for characters' size. The international
universal unit of font size is the point.

The [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_\(typography\)) is usually
abbreviated as pt, it's the smallest unit of measure in typesetting. In fact,
the size of the point has varied throughout the history of printing. Since the
18th century, the point's size has varied from 0.18 to 0.4 mm. Following the
advent of [desktop publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing)
in the 1980s and 1990s, [digital
printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_printing) has largely supplanted
the [letterpress printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press) and
gradually established the DTP point as the facto standard.

The DTP point is defined as 1/72 of an
[inch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch).

Most fonts will make the best effects when set to 10-12 pt. In other words, both
the strokes and structure of characters themselves and the spacing between
letters will present relatively good visual effects in such size. The larger the
font size, the looser the text appears, so you need to manually decrease the
letter spacing; on the other hand, the smaller the font size, the more compact
the text appears, so you need to manually increase the letter spacing.

| pt | mm     | cm      | pica | inch |
| -- | ------ | ------- | ---- | ---- |
| 1  | 0.3528 | 0.03528 | 1/12 | 1/72 |

## Leading

Leading or line-spacing refers to the distance between the baselines of two
consecutive lines.

![Leading](./static/images/1200px-Line_spacing_comparison.svg.webp)

The ideal leading is at least 120% of the text's font size, generally 1.2-1.5
times are recommended. Different fonts have different x-height, in principle,
the larger the x-height of the font applied, the larger the leading should be,
conversely, the smaller the x-height, the smaller the leading.

## Page layout

Layout is the outline of typesetting, it's like the head-rope of a fishing net,
once the head-rope is raised up, all the meshes spread naturally. In addition to
general typesetting rules for font size and leading, there are some unique
requirements in resume layout design. In principle, it's best to control the
resume in one page.

* Making the language clear and concise
* Adjusting the font size and leading within a reasonable range
* Keeping page margins in 10-25 mm and making the left and right margins
  symmetrical
* Using lists rather than parallel sentences to list information
* Using flush left alignment, taking caution to use justified alignment as
  justified alignment may cause problems in hyphenation and letter-spacing
  because the lengths of words are different


# Chinese
URL: /docs/content/multi-languages/chinese

***

## title: Chinese

The [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language) language belongs
to the [Sino-Tibetan language
family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Tibetan_language_family), which is
very much different from the Latin script languages. About 1.4 billion
people, or 17% of the world's population, speak a variety of Chinese as their
first language.

## Linguistics

### Character Set

The [Chinese characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters) and
the [Latin
characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Latin_character_sets_\(computing\))
represent two fundamentally different approaches to written language.

The Latin characters has a limited character set, where relatively few
characters are needed to represent a large vocabulary, each character represents
a specific sound or [phoneme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme), and words
are formed by combining these characters in specific sequences. Chinese, on the
other hand, has tens of thousands of characters in order to express the full
range of the Chinese language, each character represents a
[morpheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme) or word, often conveying
meaning directly, and words are formed by combining individual characters, each
with its own meaning and pronunciation.

![Chinese characters](./static/images/chinese/Chenzihmyon_typefaces.svg.png)

This fundamental difference in writing systems has significant implications for
language learning, text processing, and cultural exchange. While the Latin
characters are relatively easy to learn and use, the Chinese characters
requires significant memorization and practice.

### Variants

While there are many regional variations of the Chinese language, the two
primary written forms are Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese.

Here's a breakdown:

**Simplified Chinese**

* Primarily used in mainland China and Singapore.
* Developed in the mid-20th century to increase literacy rates.
* Uses [simplified
  characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters), often
  with fewer strokes than traditional characters.

**Traditional Chinese**

* Primarily used in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and many overseas Chinese communities.
* The older form of written Chinese.
* Uses [traditional
  characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters), with
  more and complex strokes.

It's important to note that both Simplified and Traditional Chinese can be used
to write various dialects of Chinese, such as
[Mandarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese),
[Cantonese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese), and
[Hokkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkien).

Meanwhile, Traditional Chinese has at least two variants, namely, the Hong Kong
variant [zh-HK](https://simplelocalize.io/data/locale-code/zh-HK/) and the
Taiwan variant [zh-TW](https://simplelocalize.io/data/locale-code/zh-TW/). Most
of the scripts in zh-HK and zh-TW are identical, with only a few minor
differences.

For example, the word "software", when translated to zh-HK, it is "軟件", while in
zh-TW, it is "軟體". There are about tens of words in English that are translated
differently in zh-HK and zh-TW, details
[here](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B9%81%E4%BD%93%E5%AD%97#%E7%94%A8%E8%AA%9E%E5%B7%AE%E7%95%B0).

In general, YAMLResume can't do too much for the difference between zh-HK and
zh-TW, as users have to decide which variant to use when writing resumes and
make sure that the content conforms to the idioms and convensions of zh-HK or
zh-TW. However, there is one thing that YAMLResume needs to handle properly for
zh-HK and zh-TW, as some countries and regions have different names in zh-HK and
zh-TW. [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia), for example,
is translated as "沙特阿拉伯" in zh-HK and "沙烏地阿拉伯" in zh-TW. There are also a few
other countries. YAMLResume takes [care](#location-countries-and-regions) of all
countries and regions that has different translations in zh-HK and zh-TW.

## Idioms

### Date

Dates are presented differently in English and Chinese, e.g. "Jun 2018 –
Present" in English should be translated as "2018 年 6 月至今" in Chinese，the
position of the year and month should be reversed, and the en-dash "–" should be
replaced by "至".

Meanwhile, Chinese do not use dedicated words for months, instead, it uses a
combination of an Arabic number and a character "月", making it as simple as a
game of counting.

| English         | Chinese |
| --------------- | ------- |
| January (Jan)   | 1 月     |
| February (Feb)  | 2 月     |
| March (Mar)     | 3 月     |
| April (Apr)     | 4 月     |
| May (May)       | 5 月     |
| June (Jun)      | 6 月     |
| July (Jul)      | 7 月     |
| August (Aug)    | 8 月     |
| September (Sep) | 9 月     |
| October (Oct)   | 10 月    |
| November (Nov)  | 11 月    |
| December (Dec)  | 12 月    |

### Location

Address formats differ between
[English](/content/multi-languages/english#location) and Chinese conventions.
Unlike English, when presenting a location with address, city, and country, the
general part (country, state, etc.) usually comes first in Chinese, while the
most specific part (town, address, etc.) comes last.

## Typesetting

### Font

Just like Latin script languages, Chinese has its serif font
[Song](/docs/guide/font#song) and sans-serif font [Bold](/docs/guide/font#bold). Besides,
it also has two additional font styles, [Regular](/docs/guide/font#regular) and
[Fangsong](/docs/guide/font#fangsong). You can check [Guide -> Font -> CJK
Font](/docs/guide/font#cjk-font) for more details.

YAMLResume uses Song as the main font for Chinese resumes.

### Punctuations

Chinese punctuations, like the language itself, has its own unique
characteristics. One important distinction to note is the difference between
[half-width and
full-width](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfwidth_and_fullwidth_forms)
punctuations.

The primary difference between half-width and full-width punctuations in Chinese
lies in their visual width and their intended use.

**Half-width punctuations**

* **Narrower**: these punctuations are typically used in conjunction with Latin
  characters or numbers, such as in URLs, email addresses, or code snippets.
* **Less common**: they are less commonly used in standard Chinese text, often
  used in a small portion of Latin script language phrases or paragraphs.

**Full-width punctuations**

* **Wider**: these punctuations are designed to match the width of Chinese
  characters, ensuring a visually balanced and consistent appearance in Chinese
  text.
* **More common**: they are the standard punctuation marks used in Chinese text.

Using the correct type of punctuations is crucial for proper formatting and
readability in Chinese text. Mismatched punctuations can lead to visual
inconsistencies and potential confusion.

By understanding the difference between half-width and full-width punctuations,
you can ensure that your Chinese text is correctly formatted and visually
appealing. Here is a table of punctuations in both half-width and full-width
forms, used in Latin script and Chinese languages respectively.

|                        | English | Simplified Chinese |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| Full Stop/Period (句号)  | .       | 。                  |
| Question Mark (问号)     | ?       | ？                  |
| Exclamation Mark (感叹号) | !       | ！                  |
| Comma (逗点)             | ,       | ，                  |
| Colon (冒号)             | :       | ：                  |

For resumes, it's the author's duty to use correct punctuations when composing
the content, but YAMLResume can guarantee that our resume templates will always
use the correct punctuations. We have two cases right now:

#### Comma

English uses the comma `,` as a separator to separate parts of a sentence and
items in a list, while Chinese uses a Chinese comma `，` to separate sensences,
and a dedicated enumeration comma
([顿号](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#East_Asia), `、`) to separate items in
a list (e.g. keyword list).

#### Colon

English and Chinese also have
[different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfwidth_and_fullwidth_forms) colons.
The [English colon](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+003A) is `:`, with
Unicode `U+003A`, while the [Chinese
colon](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+FF1A) is `：`, with Unicode `U+FF1A`.
As you can always trust, YAMLResume also takes care of this. We use correct
colon for various fixed terms like "Keywords:" ("关键字：" in Simplified
Chinese, "關鍵字：" in Traditional Chinese) and "Courses:" ( `课程：` in
Simplified Chinese, `課程：` in Traditional Chinese) in our resume template.

### Old Style Numbers

By default, **YAMLResume do not use [old style
numbers](/docs/guide/font#old-style-numbers) for Chinese resumes**. Why? Because
Chinese characters all have the same height and width (that is why Chinese
characters are also called "方块字", which means square characters), basically all
Chinese characters are titled and monospaced by nature. By adopting numbers in
the lining style, the number style is adapted more closely to the Chinese
characters.

### Italics

By default, **YAMLResume do not use italics in Chinese resumes** because italics
in Chinese is considered as a [bad
practice](https://drwhispers.com/2021/11/16/italics-in-chinese/), why?

In Latin script languages, italics are usually distinguished from body serifs
and are used to emphasise or differentiate parts of the text, however,
italicizing Chinese characters can disrupt the natural flow and readability of
the text.

Unlike Latin characters, Chinese characters are square characters that are not
traditionally written in italics, and many Chinese fonts do not have specific
italic glyphs for each character. When italicizing Chinese text, software often
simply slants the characters, which can result in a visually unpleasant and
unprofessional appearance.

## Translations

YAMLResume adopts the following translations for various options and terms used

## title: English

As we all know, English is widely used and spoken all over the world.

Supporting English in YAMLResume is an easy job. There's very little extra setup
to do in order to support English resumes with LaTeX.

## Linguistics

Theoretically, English belongs to [Germanic
languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages), which is a branch
of the [Indo-European language
family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages) spoken natively
by a population of about 515 million people mainly in Europe, North
America, Oceania, and Southern Africa.

### Character Set

Modern English is written with a Latin alphabet consisting of 26 letters, with
each having both uppercase and lowercase forms.

[Latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet) is the most
widely used alphabetic writing system in the world.

## Idioms

### Date

English has dedicated words for months, while each has a short form. YAMLResume
adopts the short form for all month fields by default.

| Long Form | Short Form |
| --------- | ---------- |
| January   | Jan        |
| February  | Feb        |
| March     | Mar        |
| April     | Apr        |
| May       | May        |
| June      | Jun        |
| July      | Jul        |
| August    | Aug        |
| September | Sep        |
| October   | Oct        |
| November  | Nov        |
| December  | Dec        |

### Location

Different languages present locations in different format. In English, when
presenting a location with address, city, and country, the general part
(country, state, etc.) typically comes last, while the most specific part (town,
address, etc.) comes first. In some other languages like Chinese, the order is
totally reversed.

Here's the typical order in English:

1. Address: This includes the street number, street name, apartment number, etc.
2. City: The name of the city or town.
3. State/Province: The state or province, if applicable.
4. Country: The name of the country.

## Typesetting

Lots of typesetting theory and practice can be shared by all Latin script
languages, English is no exception here. We have already prepared a
[guide](/docs/guide) which covers lots of details.

## title: Multi Languages

YAMLResume is designed to support multi languages out of the box.

Technically, there are two categories of things to do when supporting multi
languages:

* **[Internationalization](https://phrase.com/blog/posts/internationalization-vs-localization/#what-is-internationalization-i18n)**:
  often abbreviated as "i18n" (where the number 18 represents the 18 characters
  between "i" and "n"), is basically a set of practices that allow a product
  support multi languages, i18n main consists of translating the product into
  mutli languages and dynamically switching the language according to the user's
  choice
* **[Localization](https://phrase.com/blog/posts/internationalization-vs-localization/#what-is-localization-l10n)**:
  often abbreviated as "l10n" (the number 10 represents the characters between
  "l" and "n"), it goes beyond mere translation and instead adapts the product
  to the cultural specifics of the target language.

In practice, i18n always comes first, l10n comes after.

For all supported languages, we have the following concerns from a design and
implementation perspective:

* **[Linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics)**: the theorectical
  side of a language, including but not limited to the language's character set,
  syntax and grammar, history, etc.
* **Idioms**: common conventions and idioms that are generally followed by a
  language.
* **[Typesetting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting)**: best typesetting
  practices often followed by a language, such as italics, text figures, font
  style, kerning, ligature, etc.
* **Translations**: mere translations for a fixed set of terms and
  options used by resumes generated by YAMLResume.

## Supported Languages

You can use `yamlresume languages list` to list all supported languages. At the
time of writing, YAMLResume supports the following languages:

```console
$ yamlresume languages list

| `layout.locale.language` | Language Name                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| en                       | English                         |
| zh-hans                  | Simplified Chinese              |
| zh-hans-hk               | Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong) |
| zh-hans-tw               | Traditional Chinese (Taiwan)    |
| es                       | Spanish                         |
```

  <Card title="Chinese" href="/content/multi-languages/chinese" description="Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong and Taiwan) are supported." />

  <Card title="Spanish" href="/content/multi-languages/spanish" description="Spanish also uses Latin script as the primary writing system." />
</Cards>

## Glossaries

We have used the following glossaries throughout this section:

* **Latin script languages**: languages that use
  [Latin script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script) as the [writing
  systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system). Most [germanic
  languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages), [romance
  languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages) and many other
  languages like
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian\_language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language)
  use Latin script as the primary writing system.
* **[CJK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters)**: Chinese, Japanese and
  Korean languages.
* **[Character Set](https://www.creatopy.com/blog/what-is-a-character-set/)**:
  the complete collection of characters, symbols, glyphs, and punctuation marks
  available within a specific typeface or font.
* **[Glyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph)**: the specific shape, design,
  or representation of a character in typography.
* **[Hyphenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabification)**, the practice
  of breaking words at the end of lines to improve the overall appearance and
  readability of text.
* **[Justification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_alignment#Justified)**:
  the alignment of text within a block so that it is flush with both the left
  and right margins, generally achieved by adjusting the spacing between words
  and letters, creating a uniform appearance across each line of text.
* **[Kerning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning)**: the process of adjusting
  the spacing between characters in a proportional font, usually to achieve a
  visually pleasing result.
* **[Ligature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_\(writing\))**: a glyph
  that joins two or more letters together in order to enhance the visual appeal
  of text and get better readability.


# Spanish

## title: Spanish

English and Spanish are both [Indo-European
languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages), it is no
wonder that English and Spanish share some similarities, so most of the common
foundations of YAMLResume can be reused for English and Spanish.

## Linguistics

### Character Set

The character sets of English and Spanish are very similar—both languages
primarily use the [Latin
alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet), which consists of 26
letters. However, Spanish has an additional letter, the `ñ`, which
represents a unique sound. Here's a quick comparison:

| Feature                | English Character Set             | Spanish Character Set                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Alphabet**           | 26 letters (`a-z`)                | 27 letters (`a-z` plus `ñ`)                                                                     |
| **Diacritics**         | None                              | Includes accents (`á`, `é`, `í`, `ó`, `ú`), diaeresis (`ü`), and special punctuation (`¿`, `¡`) |
| **Special Characters** | Limited to basic Latin characters | Includes additional characters like `ñ` and accented vowels                                     |

The main differences between the English and Spanish's writing systems:

* **Additional letter**: the Spanish alphabet includes the letter `ñ`, which
  does not exist in the English alphabet.
* **[Diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic)**: Spanish uses
  several diacritics that change he pronunciation of vowels. For example,
  accents indicate stress and pronunciation changes (e.g., `é` vs. `e`).
* **Punctuation marks**: Spanish uses inverted punctuation marks (`¿` for
  questions and `¡` for exclamations) that are absent in English.

## Idioms

### Date

Days of the week and months are capitalised in English, but not in Spanish. For
example, "Sep 2021" in English is translated as "sept 2021" in Spanish.

YAMLResume only uses months, hence the translation table:

| English         | Spanish           |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| January (Jan)   | enero (ene)       |

### Capitalization

English tends to capitalize many words, while Spanish is more conservative and
follows a much [tigher set of
rules](https://baselang.com/blog/basic-grammar/capitalization-in-spanish/).

YAMLResume internally adopts a fixed set of options and terms for all resume
templates. For example, languages in YAMLResume resume templates adopt
[Linkedin's language fluency
options](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/language-proficiency-linkedin-duaa-ali/):

* Elementary Proficiency
* Limited Working Proficiency
* Minimum Professional Proficiency
* Full Professional Proficiency
* Native or Bilingual Proficiency

These are translated to Spanish as follows:

* Competencia elemental
* Competencia limitada de trabajo
* Competencia profesional de trabajo
* Competencia profesional plena
* Competencia nativa o bilingüe

Only the first word is capitalized.

## Typesetting

### Punctuations

Spanish has several notable differences in punctuations from English:

* **Quotation marks**: In English, periods and commas are placed inside
  quotation marks, whereas in Spanish, they are usually placed outside.
* **Inverted marks**: Spanish uses inverted question marks `¿` and
  exclamation marks `¡` at both the beginning and the end of interrogative and
  exclamatory sentences, whereas English does not.
* **Serial comma**: English often uses a serial comma before "and" in lists
  (e.g., "apples, oranges, and bananas"), whereas Spanish does not use a comma
  before "y" (e.g., "manzanas, naranjas y plátanos")
* **Numerical formats**: English uses a period is used as a decimal separator
  (e.g., 3.14), whereas Spanish uses a comma is used (e.g., 3,14).

# Templates

## title: Templates

YAMLResume provides several templates out of the box, you can list all templates
with `yamlresume templates list` command.

```console
$ yamlresume templates list

| `layout.template` | Template Name    | Description                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| moderncv-banking  | ModernCV Banking | ModernCV template with banking style |
| moderncv-casual   | ModernCV Casual  | ModernCV template with casual style  |
| moderncv-classic  | ModernCV Classic | ModernCV template with classic style |
```

By default, YAMLResume uses [moderncv-banking](./templates/moderncv-banking) template. You
can change the template by setting `layout.template` in your YAML resume.

```yaml title="resume.yml"
content:
  # ...

layout:
  # ...
  template: moderncv-classic # [!code highlight]
  # ...
```

Check out the following templates for more details:

# Moderncv Banking
URL: /docs/layout/templates/moderncv-banking

***

## title: Moderncv Banking

## Implementation

Moderncv banking is a modern and clean resume template based on
[xdanaux/moderncv](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv).

Under the hood, we use the following code for the LaTeX preamble:

```latex
\documentclass[a4paper, serif, 11pt]{moderncv}

%% moderncv
% style and color
\moderncvstyle{banking}
\moderncvcolor{black}

% needed by moderncv for showing icons
\usepackage{fontawesome5}
```

For moderncv banking style, we also adopt some special processings for
punctuations in order to make it work with CJK.

Technically speaking, English and Chinese have different colons. The English
colon is `:`, with Unicode `U+003A`, while the Chinese colon is `：`, with
Unicode `U+FF1A`. So when the resume language is Chinese, we would adopt the
Chinese colon for moderncv by overriding some magic LaTeX macros:

```latex
% renew moderncv command to adapt for CJK colon
\renewcommand*{\cvitem}[3][.25em]{%
  \ifstrempty{#2}{}{\hintstyle{#2}<= &templateTranslations.punctuations.Colon =>}{#3}%
  \par\addvspace{#1}}

\renewcommand*{\cvitemwithcomment}[4][.25em]{%
  \savebox{\cvitemwithcommentmainbox}{\ifstrempty{#2}{}{\hintstyle{#2}<= &templateTranslations.punctuations.Colon =>}#3}%
  \setlength{\cvitemwithcommentmainlength}{\widthof{\usebox{\cvitemwithcommentmainbox}}}%
  \setlength{\cvitemwithcommentcommentlength}{\maincolumnwidth-\separatorcolumnwidth-\cvitemwithcommentmainlength}%
  \begin{minipage}[t]{\cvitemwithcommentmainlength}\usebox{\cvitemwithcommentmainbox}\end{minipage}%
  \hfill% fill of \separatorcolumnwidth
  \begin{minipage}[t]{\cvitemwithcommentcommentlength}\raggedleft\small\itshape#4\end{minipage}%
  \par\addvspace{#1}}
```

request](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/pull/19), and addressed our
first [bug report](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/13). Special
thanks to [@jizusun](https://github.com/jizusun),
[@koo6666](https://github.com/koo6666), and
[@luyuhuang](https://github.com/luyuhuang) for your kind contributions!

## Why Open Source?

The first line of code for YAMLResume was actually written in 2023. It began as
the core typesetting engine for [PPResume](https://ppresume.com)—a
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)-based, commercial, pixel-perfect resume
builder that has already helped thousands of people create beautifully typeset
resumes.

While I am not ready to open source PPResume itself, I do want to give users
full control over their resumes. In December 2024, PPResume enabled users to
download the generated LaTeX code for their resumes, ensuring our [no vendor
lock-in](https://blog.ppresume.com/posts/no-vendor-lock-in) promise and giving
users complete ownership of their data.

Moreover, the development of PPResume has greatly benefited from the open source
community. I have learned a lot from it myself, and now it is time to give back.

There are very few open source tools that use YAML as a resume format. [JSON
Resume](https://jsonresume.org) is a good try—as we all know, YAML is a superset
of JSON. However, JSON Resume does not provide an opinionated solution for
resume typesetting, layout, or output, making it far less practical. YAML, on
the other hand, is a [much better choice than
JSON](/docs/comparisons#json-resume) for resume formatting.

Open sourcing YAMLResume was clearly the right decision. Check out the download
trends for YAMLResume on NPM:

![YAMLResume NPM Download Trends May-Jun
2025](./static/images/500-stars/yamlresume-download-trends-may-jun-2025.webp)

## What's Next?

Although YAMLResume has been used by a commercial resume builder for almost two
years, it is still in the early stages of development, and there is much more to
be done.

[Docker support](./yamlresume-docker) was one of the most requested features,
and I am pleased to say it is now [available](/docs/installation#docker-users).

Another important feature is data validation. Unlike PPResume, which provides a
carefully crafted and designed form for users to fill out and validate their
resume data, YAMLResume accepts unconstrained input—any `.yaml` file. We must
provide a way to [validate
input](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/10) to ensure the program
handles all forms of input gracefully.

Feature-wise, we plan to support [section
aliases](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/11) and [section
reordering](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/12), making the PDF
output more adaptable and flexible.

For developer experience, we aim to [support a `dev`
sub-command](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/25) so users can
modify resumes and see PDF changes in near real time.

Finally, some users have raised concerns about ATS compatibility. We are
committed to ensuring that the PDF output is [ATS
compatible](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/23).

Stay tuned!

YAMLResume: Resumes as Code in YAML

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';

Every developer needs a resume unless you are a world-famous professional.
Writing a resume may not be hard, but it is definitely not fun and tedious. Many
spend days crafting their resumes, chasing after a 100% typo-free, grammar
checked resumes with professional layout and typesetting.

[YAMLResume](https://yamlresume.dev) allows you to create and version control
your resumes using [YAML](https://yaml.org/) and generate professional looking
PDFs with beautiful typesetting in a breeze.

It started as the core typesetting engine for [PPResume](https://ppresume.com)—a
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) based, commercial, pixel perfect resume
builder—which already helps thousands of people create beautifully typeset
resumes. Without too much hesitation, we decided to open source it so that
people can always have the right to say [no to vendor
lock-in](https://blog.ppresume.com/posts/no-vendor-lock-in).

![YAMLResume New and Build Resume](./static/images/introducing-yamlresume/yamlresume-new-and-build.webp)

## Quick Start

YAMLResume provides a [CLI tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yamlresume),
besides, it has a mandatory dependency on a typesetting engine in order to
generate PDF. In other words, you should [install a typesetting
engine](/docs/installation#typesetting-engine) first if you want to generate
PDF.

Installing `yamlresume` CLI is a breeze. You can install it using your favourite
Node.js package manager:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager" persist items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  ```console tab="npm"
  npm install -g yamlresume
  ```

  ```console tab="pnpm"
  pnpm add -g yamlresume
  ```

  ```console tab="yarn"
  yarn global add yamlresume
  ```

  ```console tab="bun"
  bun add -g yamlresume
  ```
</Tabs>

Verify `yamlresume` is installed successfully:

```console
$ yamlresume help
Usage: yamlresume [options] [command]

YAMLResume — Resume as Code in YAML

 __   __ _    __  __ _     ____
 \ \ / // \  |  \/  | |   |  _ \ ___  ___ _   _ ___  ___   ___
  \ V // _ \ | |\/| | |   | |_) / _ \/ __| | | / _ \/ _ \ / _ \
   | |/ ___ \| |  | | |___|  _ <  __/\__ \ |_| | | | | | |  __/
   |_/_/   \_\_|  |_|_____|_| \_\___||___/\____|_| |_| |_|\___|


Options:
  -V, --version   output the version number
  -v, --verbose   verbose output
  -h, --help      display help for command

Commands:
  new [filename]  create a new resume
  build <source>  build a resume to LaTeX and PDF
  languages       i18n and l10n support
  templates       manage resume templates
  help [command]  display help for command
```

We also recommend that you install [Linux
Libertine](http://yamlresume.dev/docs/getting-started#linux-libertine) font in
order to get the best looking PDFs.

Last but not least, if you want to create a CJK resume, we also recommend that
you  install [Google Noto fonts](https://fonts.google.com/noto/) for [best
unicode coverage](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/63).

### Create a New Resume

You can create a new resume with a one-liner:

```console
$ yamlresume new my-resume.yml
✔ Created my-resume.yml successfully.
```

Under the hood `yamlresume new` would clone a sample resume from
[here](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/main/packages/cli/resources/resume.yml).
Then you can get a PDF with a one-liner again:

```console
$ yamlresume build my-resume.yml
◐ Generating resume PDF with command: xelatex -halt-on-error my-resume.tex...
✔ Generated resume PDF successfully.
```

You are done! Check out the generated resume PDF:

![Resume Page 1](./static/images/introducing-yamlresume/resume-1.webp)
![Resume Page 2](./static/images/introducing-yamlresume/resume-2.webp)

You can check [PPResume Gallery](https://ppresume.com/gallery) for more examples
powered by YAMLResume as the typesetting engine.

### Troubleshooting

YAMLResume CLI provides a verbose flag `-v`/`--verbose` to show more detailed
logging information. If you have trouble building a resume, you can try to run
the commands again with this verbose flag and paste the output into [github
issues](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues), I will take a look and
get back to you.

## How Does It Work?

Under the hood, YAMLResume works like a mini compiler, i.e, it takes an input,
parses it to an [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) and
then generates an output.

<Mermaid

A[Resumes in YAML]
A --> B[Parsing YAML to AST]
A --> C[Parsing summary field]
C --> D[Transform AST to LaTeX]
B --> D
D --> E[Compile LaTeX to PDF]
"
/>

The core design principle of YAMLResume is [separation of
concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns). One of the most
famous examples that follows this principle is HTML & CSS, which are the
foundation of the modern web—HTML is used to organize the content in a webpage,
CSS is used to define the content presentation style.

Following the core principle, YAMLResume is designed based on the following
requirements:

* the resume content should be written in plain text, which is version control
  friendly
* the plain text should use a fully structured format, which gives us more
  control and flexibility
* YAML is better than JSON because it is more human-readable and human-writable
* the YAML plain text is then rendered into a PDF with a pluggable typesetting
  engine
* an opinionated layout should be provided out of the box, while still allowing
  people to adjust options accordingly like font sizes, page margins, etc.

## Why YAML?

[JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) is another project that allows people to
create resumes in a structured format. However, most developers would agree that
YAML is better than JSON with regard to human readability and writability. For
example, it is quite inconvenient to represent multi-line strings in JSON, while
YAML has native support for it.

Compare a resume snippet in JSON and YAML:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "basics": {
      "name": "Andy Dufresne",
      "headline": "Headed for the Pacific",
      "phone": "(213) 555-9876",

Which one is more readable and writable? The answer is obvious.

JSON Resume has no concern about the layout of the resume. In the real world,
you can't just send a JSON file to recruiters right? The structured resume
format needs to be converted to a human-readable document format like docx, PDF,
etc.  YAMLResume offers an opinionated layout configuration, and guarantees
pixel perfect PDF output.

At the time of writing, YAMLResume's opinionated layout supports:

* locale languages
  * English
  * Simplified Chinese
  * Traditional Chinese
  * Spanish
* margins
  * top
  * left
  * right
  * bottom
* page numbers
* template
* typography
  * font size

Here is a sample code snippet for layout configuration in YAMLResume:

```yml
layout:
  locale:
    language: en
  margins:
    top: 2.5cm
    left: 1.5cm
    right: 1.5cm
    bottom: 2.5cm
  page:
    showPageNumbers: true
  template: moderncv-banking
  typography:
    fontSize: 11pt
```

## Why Not Markdown?

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a another popular choice
for writing resumes, there are also some resume builders that adopt markdown as
the main input format. However, markdown is a general-purpose markup language
for creating formatted text, while resumes only use a very limited set of
markdown features.

For example, the following markdown syntax are very unlikely to be used in a
resume:

* blockquote
* code block
* horizontal rules
* images
* tables
* html markup
* etc.

Second, markdown is far too flexible, often giving users more freedom than they
need to create a resume. It would be pretty hard to reliably parse a generic
markdown document as a resume.

Third, features like templates switching, precise layout control (like `\hfill`
and `\hspace` in LaTeX) is very hard to implement in markdown.

In conclusion, using a fully structured format such as YAML/JSON gives us more
control and reliability over formatting and layout for resumes.

## Why still LaTeX?

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is a very mature and stable typesetting
engine that can produce extremely high-quality PDFs. However, many LaTeX users,
even LaTeX enthusiasts, would agree that the LaTeX language is somewhat
outdated—its error messages are often quite confusing, and the reliance on
global variables often leads to conflicts between packages, the compilation
speed is slow for large documents and often quite complicated, and it produces
ugly intermediate files (`.aux`, `.log`, etc.).

Some suggest to replace LaTeX with [typst](https://github.com/typst/typst),
which is a modern typesetting engine, with much better DX and much faster
compilation. However, after careful evaluation, I decided to stick with LaTeX.
The deal breaker here is that, YAMLResume is designed to support multi languages
with the best possible typesetting quality, however, typst [CJK
support](https://blog.ppresume.com/posts/on-typesetting-engines#cjk-3) is still
unstable and lacking.

Later on I may add a new
[renderer](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/main/packages/core/src/renderer/base.ts)
backend to support typst.

## Rich Text Support

Although we have decided not to use markdown as the resume input format, we do
support a limited set of markdown rich text syntax for the `summary` field in
various sections.

For now, we support the following markdown syntax:

* `**bold**`
* `*italic*`
* `[link](https://www.google.com)`
* ordered list
* unordered list
* nested list
* paragraphs

For example, this is a sample snippet for the `content.basics.summary` field:

```yml
---
content:
  basics:
    # ...
    summary: |
      This is a sample YAML resume that support limited set of markdown rich text syntax (bold, italics, links, lists):

      - Computer Science major with **strong foundation** in data structures, *algorithms*, and software development
        1. Pixel perfect full stack web developer, specialised in creating high-quality, visually appealing websites
        2. Experiened in databases (SQL, NoSQL), familiar with server-side technologies ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), Express, etc.)
      - Team player, with detail-oriented mindset and a keen eye for design and user experiences
```

And this is the generated PDF:

![Rich Text Support in Summary Field](./static/images/introducing-yamlresume/rich-text-support-in-summary-field.webp)

You can see that the rich text syntax is rendered correctly with bold, italics,
links, lists, pretty solid, right?

## Roadmap

Overall the project is still in a very early stage, we have a long way to go.
I've already planned a list of features to do in the near future:

1. more languages, Japanese, Germany, French, etc
2. more templates
3. [section alias](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/11)
4. [section reordering](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/12)
5. [schema validation](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/10)

For any trouble, you can:

* raise an [issue](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/)
* open a [discussion](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/discussions)
* leave a [message](https://discord.gg/9SyT7mVV4K)

I am super excited to announce that YAMLResume now has a [docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/yamlresume/yamlresume), and you can [run
YAMLResume instantly with docker](https://asciinema.org/a/722057).

![YAMLResume Docker

## Why Docker?

YAMLResume is a Node.js CLI tool and a
[library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yamlresume/core). Installing YAMLResume
itself is not difficult since it only requires Node.js. In fact, we can even compile it
to a binary and run it directly without installing Node.js.

However, YAMLResume has a mandatory dependency on LaTeX, which brings some new
problems:

* Installing LaTeX takes time; it usually takes about 5–10 minutes to download a
  proper LaTeX distribution and configure it.
* LaTeX is not a single binary program; it is a collection of programs. Some
  users [dislike installing many programs on their
  machines](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/6#issuecomment-2916479009).

Although we already provide a very comprehensive [installation
guide](/docs/installation) covering macOS, Windows, Ubuntu, and RHEL, even with
instructions on installing YAMLResume and LaTeX and making them work together,
the process can still be painful for some users.

Docker is a great solution to these problems: it can package everything into a
single image, making installation and configuration easy.

## How To Use It

A picture is worth a thousand words. Here is a screenshot showing how to use it:

![YAMLResume Docker
Demo](./static/images/yamlresume-docker/yamlresume-docker-demo.svg)

Our [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/yamlresume/yamlresume) has
everything pre-packaged, including:

* [Node.js](/docs/installation#nodejs)
* [yamlresume CLI](/docs/installation#yamlresume)
* [XeTeX](/docs/installation#xetex)
* [some recommended fonts](/docs/installation#font)

You can create a new resume instantly with the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/yamlresume yamlresume/yamlresume new my-resume.yml
```

Edit `my-resume.yml` accordingly and then build the resume from YAML to PDF:

```sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/yamlresume yamlresume/yamlresume build my-resume.yml
```

#### Under the Hood

If you are familiar with docker, you may already know how this works. If not,
here is a quick explanation:

1. `docker run ... yamlresume/yamlresume` - runs a new container from the
   `yamlresume/yamlresume` image. If this image does not exist on your local
   machine, it will pull it from the [docker
   Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/yamlresume/yamlresume).
2. `--rm` - automatically removes the container when it exits.
3. `-v $(pwd):/home/yamlresume` - mounts the current directory (`$(pwd)`) into
   the container at `/home/yamlresume`, allowing the container to access local
   files.
4. `new my-resume.yml` or `build my-resume.yml` - runs the yamlresume CLI
   [new](/docs/cli#new) or [build](/docs/cli#build) sub-command to create or
   build a resume with the filename `my-resume.yml`.

Basically, you can call all of the `yamlresume` [CLI sub-commands](/cli) in this
way—just append the sub-command after `yamlresume/yamlresume` and then follow
the corresponding usage guide.

The `-v` flag is quite important because it mounts the current directory
(`$(pwd)`) into the container at `/home/yamlresume`, allowing two-way file sync
between the local directory and the container. Without this flag, the build
output artifact will be lost after the container exits.

## Engineering

Building a docker image is not difficult if you know docker a bit. However,
wrapping YAMLResume in docker is not as easy as it sounds. Here are some of the
challenges.

### LaTeX Configuration is Tedious

Installing a workable LaTeX distribution takes time; it usually takes about 5–10
minutes to download and configure a proper LaTeX distribution. In GitHub Action
runners, this process is [even longer—up to 20+
minutes](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/actions/runs/15438395862/job/43450134447).

```docker
RUN apt update && \
    apt install -y \
    texlive-xetex \
    texlive-fonts-extra \
    texlive-lang-all \
    fonts-noto-cjk \
    fonts-noto-cjk-extra \
```

We make it a 3-step process to build [yamlresume's docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/yamlresume/yamlresume):

1. Start from a Node.js image as the base.
2. Install and configure a LaTeX distribution.
3. Install the yamlresume CLI.

As mentioned, step 2 is the most time-consuming part. If we had to start over
every time we needed to update the docker image, it would take 30 minutes to
build the docker image in a github action runner.

To avoid this, we use a multi-stage build to cache the LaTeX distribution, so we
don't need to install it from scratch every time we update the docker image.

Therefore, we created a new
[yamlresume/yamlresume-base](https://hub.docker.com/r/yamlresume/yamlresume-base),
which is a base image that has Node.js and a LaTeX distribution installed. This
base image is stable and won't be updated too often, and our `yamlresume/yamlresume`
image is built on top of this base image. It only takes 3 minutes to pull down
the `yamlresume/yamlresume-base` image and install the yamlresume CLI on it,
which drastically reduces the iteration time.

### Multi-Platform Support

Another challenge is to support [multi-platform
builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/). As we know,
macOS M1 and later are ARM-based machines. Although they can run docker images
with AMD64 architecture by emulation, the performance is 10x poorer.

Hence, we have to support multi-platform images for `yamlresume/yamlresume`.
Luckily, docker officially provides a detailed guide about how to [build
multi-platform images in github
actions](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/multi-platform/).

YAMLResume's docker image supports [two
platforms](https://hub.docker.com/r/yamlresume/yamlresume/tags): `linux/amd64`
and `linux/arm64`, which should be sufficient to cover most desktop and server
machines.

Enjoy YAMLResume with docker!
