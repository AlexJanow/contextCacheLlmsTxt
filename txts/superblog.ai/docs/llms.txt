# Deploy
Whenever you make any change in your Superblog like updating settings, adding a new post, editing a post, or anything else you can see the "Deploy" button is activated. 

Read more [here](./../dashboard/deploy.md)


## Trigger a deploy


You can send a `POST` request as below to retieve a list of posts.

#### Javascript

```js
const response = await fetch(
  // you can change the page number for pagination
  "https://write.superblog.ai/api/sites/supername/your-supername/deploy",
  {
    headers: {
      //.....
      //.....
      "x-superblog-access-key": "your-api-key",
    },
  }
);

const data = await response();
```

# Intro
Superblog API is completely based on REST.
It is as intuitive as it can get. 

Entire superblog dashboard is built with REST API. So, any action that you can do in dashboard can also be done with API.

You need to be on the [SUPER](https://superblog.ai/pricing) plan for API access.

#### Note
Sample code is shown in the docs is in Javascript. But you can use <b>ANY language</b> to interact with superblog API. 

## Authentication

1. Generate an API key from `View Dashboard > Data > API Keys` section.
2. Pass the obtained API key with every request in a custom header `x-superblog-access-key`.

### Example

#### Javascript

```js
const response = await fetch("https://write.superblog.ai/api/sites", {
    headers: {
        //.....
        //.....
        "x-superblog-access-key": "your-api-key",
    }
});

const data = await response();

```


## Endpoints

Every single action that you do in [superblog dashboard](https://write.superblog.ai) is an endpoint.

You can open developer tools in Google Chrome and Visit `Network` tab to see the endpoints, request, and response data.


## Supername / Superblog Id

You will notice a `supername` component in the url slug for endpoints. It is nothing but the id of your superblog address that you can entered during creation of superblog.

# Posts

## Retrieve Posts

You can send a `GET` request as below to retieve a list of posts.

#### Javascript

```js
const response = await fetch(
  // you can change the page number for pagination
  "https://write.superblog.ai/api/sites/supername/your-supername/posts?page=1&getPostContent=true",
  {
    headers: {
      //.....
      //.....
      "x-superblog-access-key": "your-api-key",
    },
  }
);

const data = await response();
```

## Create a post

You can send a `POST` request as below to create a new post.

#### Javascript

```js
const response = await fetch(
  "https://write.superblog.ai/api/sites/supername/your-supername/posts",
  {
    headers: {
      //.....
      //.....
      "x-superblog-access-key": "your-api-key",
    },
    // Mandatory fields
    body: JSON.stringify({

        status: "PUBLISHED",
        hideSharingIcons: false,
        enableComments: false,
        title: "sample post title hola",

# Categories

```View Dashboard > Categories```

You can select a category for a post from the post editor page.

## Categories on Home page

You can add categories section on your blog's homepage.

![Image](./../../static/img/categories-homepage.png "superblog post categories home page")


### How to configure

Visit `View Dashboard > Settings > Advanced section`

### Note
If a post has no category assigned then the first tag of the post is displayed below the post title on the homepage.

## Exclude posts of certain categories from homepage

You can select certain categories to be excluded, then the posts of those categories will not be displayed on the homepage but they will be available as individual posts on their specific urls.

### How to configure

Visit `View Dashboard > Settings > Advanced section`

# Custom Domain

`View Dashboard > Custom Domain`

You can connect Superblog to your own domain. It can be a subdomain or subdirectory.  
Once you enter your desired URL like `blog.example.com` or `example.com/blog` in the text box, click the `Connect` button to receive instructions.

![Image](./../../static/img/custom-domain.png "superblog custom domain")

## Subdomain

Connecting your subdomain `blog.example.com` to Superblog is probably the easiest way. If you are non-technical or not really focused on SEO then choose this method.

However, most SEO experts say to use a subdirectory instead of a subdomain. Read more about this [here](https://superblog.ai/blog/blog-hosting-subdomain-vs-subfolder-cklto3qsr00101imuikysv7yd).

## Subdirectory

For the best SEO benefits, prefer connecting your blog to a subdirectory like `example.com/blog`. Configuring this is a bit technical and might require expert guidance.

But do not panic, once you connect your required URL, step-by-step instructions will be shown in the Superblog dashboard itself. You can select your tech stack to receive the configuration details.

It'll take around 10 minutes to superblog on your subdirectory.

### Note

Typically, you can setup a reverse proxy or Superblog provides one for you.  
(No additional purchase is needed, it is included in the plan)

However if you want to optimize the images and store them in Superblog CDN automatically then you need to run the migration after upgrading to a paid plan.

## Migrate From WordPress

You can import your existing WordPress posts to Superblog in less than 2 minutes with one click.

![Image](./../../static/img/data-import.png "superblog migration from other platforms")

For example, if your WordPress installation is at the root URL of your domain called mysamplesite.com then enter http://mysamplesite.com (if you have SSL, then https).

Some people might be confused about it because they have their blog at mysamplesite.com/blog and tend to enter that URL. Always enter the URL of your WordPress installation as mentioned above.

### Special cases

1. Sometimes, your root domain will be mysamplesite.com and your WordPress is installed in mysamplesite.com/blog. Then you need to enter https://mysamplesite.com/blog.

## Import from Zip file

You can import upto to 300 blog posts from a zip file into Superblog in less than 2 minutes with one click.

1. The zip file can contain .html or .md files.
1. If there any image URLs in the posts, they will be automatically downloaded and uploaded to superblog CDN for maximum performance. (only on paid plans)
1. This feature is available only in SUPER and higher plans.

![Image](./../../static/img/original/data-import-zip.png "superblog import from zip file")

## Export Superblog data

You can export your complete Superblog data like posts, tags, categories, authors in case you want to move out of Superblog at any point of time. The data is downloaded as a JSON file. You can [convert the JSON file to CSV file](https://www.convertcsv.com/json-to-csv.htm) and import it into your favorite CMS.

You can then use the JSON file to import in WordPress using JSON-importer plugin. Or you can use the JSON file programmatically in any CMS. However you need to download the images manually at this point of time.

[Here is a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w49K3txnmVc) to import superblog data into WordPress. The PRO version of this plugin will automatically download the images.

**Note:**
Always delete your superblog after you confirm the data migration.

![Image](./../../static/img/data-export.png "download superblog data")

## API Keys

You need to be on PRO or higher plan to use this feature. API keys are useful if you want to manage your Superblog via API.

![Image](./../../static/img/data-api-keys.png "superblog migration from other platforms")

1. Click on the 'Generate API key' button to generate a new API key.
1. Copy the code somewhere safe, because you will be able to see it ever again.
1. Click on the "Revoke" button to invalidate the API key.

# Deploy


Whenever you make any change in your Superblog like updating settings, adding a new post, editing a post, or anything else you can see the **"Deploy"** button is activated. It is seen in the top right of the dashboard.

You need to click the "Deploy" button to make those changes live. You do NOT need to click "Deploy" after every change. Instead, make all the changes you want and then **Deploy** **once** in the end. **ONCE**.

You will get an email alert after your Superblog is deployed.

![Image](./../../static/img/deploy.png "superblog deploy button")
<!-- <img alt="superblog deploy button" src={useBaseUrl("/img/deploy.png")} /> -->


## Why does it take time to deploy?
You might have noticed that Superblog is blazing fast when compared to WordPress, Medium, Ghost, and almost any other blogging platform out there. It is because Superblog uses a new technology.

If you click the ‘Deploy’ button then your entire blog is re-built into small bits and pieces. Then those are optimized for Speed and SEO to be stored in multiple locations around the world (CDN). That's why it takes a minute or two to deploy. 

When a visitor wants to read your blog, it is served from a server that is located nearest to that visitor.

## What is deploy limit?

If you have received an email that says "You have reached deploy limit" then do not panic. It is simply a measure to prevent abuse of the platform.

The best approach is to make a number of changes (like updating settings, editing existing posts, publishing a new post, changing theme color, etc.,) and then click the 'Deploy' button ONCE at the end.

However, if you need more quota for a day, you can write an email to support to get it reset.

## Pro Tip

Deploy button gets activated whenever you make a change in your dashboard. For example: edit a post, change a setting, add a menu item, etc.

Instead of clicking deploy each time, you can perform all activities and click **deploy once in the end**.

<!-- <img alt="customize superblog lead gen form" src={useBaseUrl("img/leadgen-form-samples.png")} /> -->

## Advanced Options

Normally, you can setup lead generation for your entire superblog at once. But if you wish you setup different forms for different posts, you can do that using the **"Advanced Options"** button in the post editor while you are editing a post.

## Form

It will be shown below every blog post and also on the homepage of your Superblog.
The form colors are automatically mapped to your Superblog's theme color.

![Image](./../../static/img/leadgen-form-samples.png "superblog lead gen form samples")

Popups must be used cautiously. They cause a bad UX in the reading flow. That's why, Superblog provides popup feature with best practices in mind.

1. Popup is shown only when a visitor tries to exit from the posts page.
1. Popup is not shown when the visitor tries to exit from the home page or any other pages.

![Image](./../../static/img/leadgen-popup-sample.png "superblog lead gen popup")

## Sidebar

A sibebar widget can be used to redirect users to your desired URL or collect email, phone number, or other custom fields. It will be shown on every post.

![Image](./../../static/img/leadgen-sidebar-sample.png "superblog lead gen sidebar widget")

## Download leads

You can download all the leads as a CSV file by clicking the 'Download Icon' button.

## Zapier integration

You can connect your Superblog to Zapier using official Superblog Integration. This is available only on SUPER plan.

1. You need to give a http endpoint in the config section.
2. You need to give a bearer token (only the token without "Bearer") so that you can have some authentication while superblog makes a http `POST` request.

## Newsletter feature

There is no newsletter feature. Superblog is built with businesses in mind.
The probability of a reader filling the lead-gen/inquiry form is much much higher than a newsletter subscription form.

However you can customzie the lead generation form to act as a "Subscribe Form".

Once your readers fill the form, you get an email alert and you can manage them from your superblog dashboard. You can download that list to integrate with any other mailing solution or Connect Superblog to Zapier to setup automation.

## Note

This is feature is disabled during trial period to prevent abuse of the platform.

## SEO best Practices

<!-- <img alt="superblog SEO best practices" src={useBaseUrl("img/posts-seo-best-practices.png")} />   -->

![Image](./../../static/img/posts-seo-best-practices.png "superblog SEO best practices")

You might have noticed the **SEO Best Practices** section on the post editor page. They are opiniated guidelines to make your post rank better on search engines. Let us try to understand more.

#### Title

This is the title of the post. Make sure your post’s title is around 8-12 words and has your post’s keyword.

#### Content

This is the contents of your post.

#### Images

Always include images in your posts. A picture is worth 1000 words.

#### Headings

Format your content properly. You need to have at least two headings. Write a catchy sentence to explain the section of your post and use the “Heading” format from the toolbar. Internally superblog will convert a heading to h2 which is good for SEO.

#### Subheadings

Format your content properly. You need to have at least 1 subheading. “Subheading” format from the toolbar. Internally superblog will convert a heading to h3 which is good for SEO.

#### Tags

You need to tag your post with relevant topics. For example, if you are writing a post on “Impact of covid in 2021 on health care industry” then you use tags like covid, healthcare, planning etc.

You can add the tags from the right-side “tag” editor.

#### Internal links

This is a very high-level SEO concept. All your blog posts should link to each other. So, make sure that you add a link to posts on your blog.

For example, let us assume you have a post on your blog with the topic of “Understanding economics of scale”. If you are writing a new post with the topic of “Scaling a business with 3 proven ways” then make sure you add a link to your previous post.


## Table of Contents (TOC)

Sometimes you might have a lengthy post. Or may be you just need to structure the post with headings, subheadings, and provide a glance of the post content. Superblog has this functionality built-in.


<!-- ### Automatic Mode -->

Superblog generates a ToC for every post that has Headings(h2) and Subheadings(h3) automatically. But superblog only shows h2 in the ToC container. You do not need to perform any action for to enable this. The ToC is placed at the top left of the blog post on desktops and at the beginnning of the post's body in mobiles.

<!-- ### Manual

Sometimes you might need to place the ToC somewhere inside the post instead of at the beginning. Or maybe you need to manually edit/add something in the ToC. So, there is an option to generate the ToC manually also.

### How to add ToC manually

It is very easy to generate a ToC for your post.

1. Write your complete post with headings and subheadings.
1. Click the "ToC" button in the editor toolbar as shown in the below image.
1. The ToC is generated at the cursor position if it is not already added.
1. You can remove the existing ToC by clicking the ToC button again.

![Image](./../../static/img/posts-editor-toc-toolbar.png "superblog table of contents")

### Preview

When you generate the ToC manually, it is added within the post editor.

The position of ToC on your blog is based on the width of the post page. If the page is wide enough (like a desktop) then the ToC is visible as a sticky section on the left. Otherwise, it is shown inline. -->

If you want to disable the ToC on any post, you can do so from the "Advanced Options" of each post.


### Desktop

![Image](./../../static/img/posts-editor-toc-preview-desktop.png "superblog table of contents desktop preview")

### Mobile

![Image](./../../static/img/posts-editor-toc-preview-mobile.png "superblog table of contents mobile preview")

### Note

Superblog hides subheadings (h3) from ToC as a best practice. However, if you insist to have them appear along with Headings then you can enter the below CSS in `Settings > Expert > Custom CSS` section.

```css
.__se__tag.__se__toc-new-container li.toc-subheading {
    display: none;
    list-style: none;
    margin-left: 0;
    padding-left: 0;
}
```

## Change the date of creating/publishing

You can change the date of creating/publishing a post by clicking the "Date" of the post in the right side section.

![Image](./../../static/img/posts-change-date.png "superblog change post date")

## Change the post author

<!-- <img alt="superblog change post author" src={useBaseUrl("img/posts-change-author.png")} /> -->

![Image](./../../static/img/posts-change-author.png "superblog change post author")

## Review

![Image](./../../static/img/posts-review.png "superblog post review click element")

Team members (editors, admins, owner) can review a post and leave comments in the editor itself. An email notification will be sent for each comment to the post's author and to anyone else that participated in the review.

![Image](./../../static/img/posts-review-box.png "superblog post review comments box")

## Tags

You can add related tags to a post. These will be added to your post as `meta keywords`. Be wise, do NOT stuff keywords here. Your readers can browse posts based on the tags.

![Image](./../../static/img/posts-tags.png "superblog post tags")

Click the [**Advanced Options**](#advanced-options) button in the post editor to see this button (you can find it on the right side). You can also use nested slugs for a post.

Examples:

```
https://example.com/blog/my-post-1
https://blog.example.com/my-post-2
https://example.com/blog/travel/my-post-3
https://example.com/blog/tech/my-post-4

```


<!-- ![Image](./../../static/img/posts-slug.png "superblog post slug") -->

#### Note

1. You might have noticed a unique set of characters being attached to every post’s URL as shown below. That is the post id.

2. Superblog creates the post URL in the below format if you haven't set a [custom slug](#post-urlslug).

Example:
`https://example.com/blog/my-example-post-title-1cko8rasqs5nerasf0g`

This is the standard structure for superblog URLs. You need not worry about them.

1. Do they affect SEO?
   No.

1. Can you change it?
   Yes.

1. You need to manually assign a slug to a post for custom URL. Otherwise the auto-generated slug will be generated using the title of the post.

### Schema Markup

Schema Markup (also known as structured data) is a powerful tool for enhancing your website's SEO and improving how your content appears in search engine results. It provides search engines with additional context about your content, making it easier for them to understand and categorize your pages.

If you add [FAQs](#faq-module) to your post, they are automatically added to the Schema Markup.

#### Why is Schema Markup important for SEO?

1. **Rich Snippets**: Schema markup can lead to rich snippets in search results, which are more visually appealing and informative, potentially increasing click-through rates.

2. **Improved Search Visibility**: By providing clear, structured information about your content, you increase the chances of appearing in relevant search results and featured snippets.

3. **Better Understanding by Search Engines**: Schema helps search engines comprehend the context and relationships within your content, leading to more accurate indexing.


Superblog offers two ways to implement Schema Markup:


1. Auto
2. Manual

#### 1. Auto

Superblog automatically adds a valid JSON schema to all your blog posts.

**Default schema:**
```json
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org/",
  "@type": "BlogPosting",
  "author": [
    {
      "@type": "Person",
      "name": "<Post Author Name>",
      "url": "Author page url on your superblog"
    }
  ],
  "headline": "Post Title",
  "description": "It will be added if there is a meta description added by you"
  "image": "<Post coverimage/thumbnail url>",
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "<Your superblog name that you added in settings>general",
    "logo": {
      "@type": "ImageObject",
      "url": "<Your logo url that you added in settings>advanced"
    }
  }
}
</script>

```

**Note:**
```Author``` type is ```Person``` by default. If you hide the author names via settings then this type will be set as ```Organisation``` and your website url will be added to maintain Schema standards.



#### 2. Manual

You can add a schema markup (also known as structured data) for your posts (JSON LD/JSON+LD format) manually if you want to override the automatic schema.

Click on the **Set Schema Markup** button.

![Image](./../../static/img/posts-schema-markup.png "superblog set post schema markup button")

![Image](./../../static/img/posts-schema-markup-preview.png "superblog post schema markup preview")

Click the [**Advanced Options**](#advanced-options) button in the post editor to see this button (you can find it on the right side).

#### Example

```js
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
    "@context": "https://schema.org/",
    "@type": "BlogPosting",
    "@id": "https://dataliberate.com/2019/05/14/library-metadata-evolution-final-mile/#BlogPosting",
    "mainEntityOfPage": "https://dataliberate.com/2019/05/14/library-metadata-evolution-final-mile/",
    "headline": "Library Metadata Evolution: The Final Mile",
    "name": "Library Metadata Evolution: The Final Mile",
    "description": "When Schema.org arrived on the scene I thought we might have arrived at the point where library metadata  could finally blossom; adding value outside of library systems to help library curated resources become first class citizens, and hence results, in the global web we all inhabit.  But as yet it has not happened.",
    "datePublished": "2019-05-14",
    "dateModified": "2019-05-14",
    "author": {
        "@type": "Person",
        "@id": "https://dataliberate.com/author/richard-wallis/#Person",
        "name": "Richard Wallis",
        "url": "https://dataliberate.com/author/richard-wallis/",
    },
    "url": "https://dataliberate.com/2019/05/14/library-metadata-evolution-final-mile/",
    "keywords": [
        "Bibframe2Schema.org",
        "Libraries",
        "Library of Congress"
    ]
}
</script>

```

### Multiple Schema Markup

You can also add multiple schemas to a page using the same method. Just put your schemas in an array as shown below.

#### Example

```js
<script type="application/ld+json">
[
    {
    "@context": "https://schema.org/",
    "@type": "BlogPosting",
    "@id": "https://dataliberate.com/2019/05/14/library-metadata-evolution-final-mile/#BlogPosting",
    "mainEntityOfPage": "https://dataliberate.com/2019/05/14/library-metadata-evolution-final-mile/",
    "headline": "Library Metadata Evolution: The Final Mile",
    "name": "Library Metadata Evolution: The Final Mile",
    "description": "When Schema.org arrived on the scene I thought we might have arrived at the point where library metadata  could finally blossom; adding value outside of library systems to help library curated resources become first class citizens, and hence results, in the global web we all inhabit.  But as yet it has not happened.",
    "datePublished": "2019-05-14",
    "dateModified": "2019-05-14",
    "author": {
        "@type": "Person",
        "@id": "https://dataliberate.com/author/richard-wallis/#Person",
        "name": "Richard Wallis",
        "url": "https://dataliberate.com/author/richard-wallis/",
    },
    "url": "https://dataliberate.com/2019/05/14/library-metadata-evolution-final-mile/",
    "keywords": [
        "Bibframe2Schema.org",
        "Libraries",
        "Library of Congress"
    ]
},

{
 "@context": "http://schema.org",
 "@type": "FAQPage",
 "name": "FAQ on Widgets",

## Thumbnail / Cover image

You can add a custom featured image to a post. The ratio of the cover image must be 3:2 (width: height). This image is not shown in the post. It is used for post thumbnail only. It is also used as OG Image (open graph image) for the social sharing preview.

If you don't add a featured image then Superblog uses the first image in a post as the thumbnail/cover image (banner image) for the post. The images you upload will be scaled without losing proportions accordingly. Also, the images are auto-compressed to reduce their size and load fast.

You can upload the first image to be in the ratio of 3:2 (width:height) to be displayed correctly in the cover image. If there is no image present in a post then Superblog will automatically render a dynamic image as the cover image.

If you do not add an image in your post or assign a thumbnail to your post, superblog will add beautiful [dynamic thumbnails](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/s-kris_now-superblog-creates-a-dynamic-cover-image-activity-7150044494661308416-bSgx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) to your posts automatically.

## Social Preview / OG Image

Read above

### Note

If you change the first image in your post and want the social media to show the latest image as preview image then you need to force the said social media to refresh to their cache. Here is an article that explains how to [refresh social media preview image](https://superblog.ai/blog/how-to-update-a-website-link-preview-on-social-media-cksptmtol00121zlep5hlxa6z).

<!-- <img alt="superblog image alt vs description" src={useBaseUrl("img/posts-image-alt-desc.png")} /> -->

![Image](./../../static/img/posts-image-alt-desc.png "superblog image alt vs description")

<br/><br/>

When you try to upload an image in the post editor, you can see **Alternative text** and **Insert description** fields.

1. Alternative text is shown when an Image isn’t available. (standard web practice, also useful for SEO)
1. Description is shown below the uploaded image. This is typically used to describe the image or credit the image's source or photographer.

![Image](./../../static/img/settings-expert-homepage.png "superblog home page content")

**Note**<br/>
1. If you choose a static page or custom html as your home page then your blog posts will be available on "/posts/1" URL. See the example below.
1. This is generally used when you want to build a whole website with superblog. You can simply design a page and choose it to display on homepage instead of list of posts.

**Example**<br/>
yourwebsite.com => your custom designed page<br/>
yourwebsite.com/posts/1 => your blog posts

### Miscellaneous scripts (Custom JS)

You can add custom javascript to your Superblog by visiting `settings>expert` section. It can be your own javascript or thrid-party widget code. For example: help chat widget, analytics tracking code, popup-scripts etc.

![Image](./../../static/img/superblog-settings-expert-misc-scripts.png "add custom misc scripts to superblog")

#### Example

```js
<script>
    alert("hello");
</script>
```

#### Note

1. All the code entered here will be present in `<body/>` section of your Superblog.
1. Adding unoptimized scripts or too many scripts might reduce the performance score of your Superblog.

### Head scripts (Custom JS)

You can add custom javascript to `<head/>` section of your Superblog by visiting `settings>expert` section. It can be your own javascript or thrid-party widget code. For example: help chat widget, analytics tracking code, popup-scripts etc.

#### Example

```js
<script>
    alert("hello");
</script>
```

#### Note

Adding unoptimized scripts or too many scripts might reduce the performance score of your Superblog.

### Custom CSS

You can add custom CSS to your Superblog by visiting `settings>expert` section. This feature will allow you to modify your Superblog with fine changes.

![Image](./../../static/img/superblog-settings-expert-custom-css.png "add custom misc scripts to superblog")

#### Example

```css
/* this will make the post's title align to the center of the page */

.post-title {
    text-align: center;
}
```

#### Live Superblogs

Superblog's customers are very creative. They add beautiful CSS and JS to modify the look and feel of their Superblogs to match their needs.

[View custom superblogs](https://superblog.ai/blog/customize-superblog)

### Custom Robots.txt

You can use custom Robots.txt file. Just copy-paste a valid robots.txt file contents into the text area and click deploy.

It will be available in

**subdirectory:** yourwebsite.com/blog/robots.txt

**subdomain:** blog.yourwebsite.com/robots.txt

### Generate LLMs.txt

The world is moving towards AI. Many companies like ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Google Gemini, etc., need to have their datasets trained on content. So, your content should be in a format that can be easily discoverable, indexable, and understandable by AI engines (LLMs technically).

If you enable this option, superblog will automatically convert all your existing blog posts into a format that is easily understood by AI engines and store it in a file called `LLMs.txt`.

It will be available in

**subdirectory:** yourwebsite.com/blog/LLMs.txt

**subdomain:** blog.yourwebsite.com/LLMs.txt

#### Note
1. Depending on the number of blog posts you have, this process can take some time. Your deployment time will be increased. Please be patient. This is the trade-off you make.
1. You can disable this option if you don't want to use LLMs.txt.


### Disqus Comments System

You can use Disqus as your comments sytem instead of Superblog's native comments.
Once you enter your Disqus shortname, Disqus comment system will be shown in place of Sueprblog's native comments.

### Redirects

You can use redirects to redirect from old post url to new url. (301 redirect)<br/>


For example:

```
yourwebsite.com/blog/old-post-url -> yourwebsite.com/blog/new-post-url
```

```
blog.yourwebsite.com/blog/old-post-url -> https://example.com/abc/123
```

# Tags

```View Dashboard > Tags```

You can add multiple tags to each post. All the tags added to different posts are showed in `Tags` section. You can edit or delete a tag by clicking the respective icon.

<!-- <img alt="superblog team member roles" src={useBaseUrl("img/team-roles.png")} /> -->
![Image](./../../static/img/tags.png "superblog post tags")

## Note
1. A common bad practice followed by beginners is to add too many tags to a post. Do NOT add too many tags to a post.  

For example, consider a post with title **"Best software to check grammar misatkes in paragraphs"**.  
You can add tags like "software" , "writing tools". That's it! Do not stuff so many keywords. It won't help in SEO.

2. If a post has no category assigned then the first tag of the post is displayed below the post title on the homepage.---

# FAQ

These are some of the common and frequently asked questions that might come up when using superblog.

## Can we track outbound links?

Tracking outbound links is a common requirement for bloggers. It lets you know how often an external URL was clicked, which page the clicks occured on, etc.

Superblog provides this feature out-of-the-box. External link clicks will be tracked as events on your analytics dashboard. They will be displayed as <b>Outbound Link Click</b>, but you can expand the event to reveal the external links that have been clicked by your visitors.

![Image](./../static/img/faq-outbound-links.png "track Outbound links in superblog")

## Why are many pages of my superblog not indexed on Google?

You might be seeing that certain pages of your superblog are not indexed on Google. This can be observed from your Google Search Console or other SEO tools like Ahrefs or SEMRush.

This is 100% intentional.

They are all tag/category/navigation/comments pages (Not blog posts). They are good with no index tag. We are not blocking Google to read it, we are only asking not to index those pages to avoid competition among your own pages.

That's the whole point of superblog. You don't need to worry about these SEO best practices. They come with the platform.

## Why is the content pasted from google docs and other sources badly formatted?

This is a common issue for text editors. Pasting content from outside sources will cause formatting issues.

### How to avoid this issue

You can export your content from Google Docs or Notion or other sources into .docx, or .html, or .md (markdown) files and then import that files into Superblog for seamless experience.

Read more: https://superblog.ai/docs/dashboard/posts#import-post

## Can we add author info/bio below the blog posts?

No. Superblog is specifically designed to bring traffic from your blog to your website. That's why there is a 'Site Description' box below each blog post (which acts as a CTA to your landing page) instead of a common Author/Bio section.

However, you can manually add about the author in the post itself if you need.

## Why the pagespeed score is low for my Superblog?

Superblog targets for 90+ score in Google's Lighthouse Audit on an average (combination of all the scores). If your superblog has less than 90, then the below could be possible reasons:

1. You might have added large Javascript to your superblog.
1. You might have added large embeds in your blog post. (ex: twitter threads, apple podcasts, etc).
1. You might have embedded Youtube player directly using embed code. Instead, embed it by clicking "Video" icon in the post editor's toolbar.
1. You have added Google Analytics or Gtag scripts (there is an inbuilt tracking module for superblog which is lightweight) or maybe you are using custom tracking scripts that could be causing an issue.
1. If you configured your superblog on a subdirectory (for example: yourwebsite.com/blog), then the request will hit your server first to handle the reverse proxy. So please check if it is causing delays in response and rewrites (proxy) which will reduce the pagescores.
1. You might be auditing the home page of your superblog. You should audtiting the post URL to get the accurate scores.

## Why the lighthouse (core web vitals) assessment failed for blog URLs?

This will happen only when you are using superblog on a subdirectory due to the below reasons. Just click on the <code>i</code> icon as shown in the below image.

![Image](./../static/img/faq-cwv-failed.jpeg "core web vitals assessment failed in superblog")

1. If you click on the <code>i</code> icon as shown in the above image, you will understand that the real world data is not available for this particular URL and hence Google is showing the aggregate data for the entire website (including ALL your pages, not just blog). So, this is not a problem from superblog's side. You need to fix your website's performance.

1. Since you are using superblog on a subdirectory (for example: yourwebsite.com/blog), then the request will hit your server first to handle the reverse proxy. So please check if it is causing delays in response and rewrites (proxy).

## Why do I see my blog post URLs twice in Google Search Console or other Analytics solutions?

If you haven't configured redirect of URLs ending with and without forward slash (/), then you will see 2 urls of same post in your analytics solution (could be search console or google analytics, etc.) as the users could end up on different versions of the URL. (but google will only index one URL, i.e, your preffered URL because superblog sets canonical URL by default).

Example:

https://mywebsite.com/blog/my-post-abc

https://mywebsite.com/blog/my-post-abc/

You might need to set a redirect one URL to other (your preferred URL) on your server.
This only happens if you configured superblog on your subdirectory.

## What is the sitemap URL for my superblog?

Your superblog's sitemap.xml is always at the root.

For example:

https://blog.yourwebsite.com/sitemap.xml (subdomain)

https://yourwebsite.com/blog/sitemap.xml (subdirectory)

## Why are my latest posts not getting indexed on Google?

Make sure your site's configuration is correct.
Your website's robots.txt should contain your [superblog's sitemap](#what-is-the-sitemap-url-for-my-superblog).

Here's a example of correct config:
https://superblog.ai/robots.txt

### Note

1. If you list your blog post URLs manually in your sitemap.xml then you can skip mentioning your superblog's sitemap in the robots.txt. However, just do it no matter what.
2. If the problem remains even after the above, try to manually index the URLs in Google Search Console.
3. If the problem remains even after the above, your content is of low quality.

## How to automatically approve comments from a specific user?

Generally, users need to approve their comments before they are published on your blog by verifying their email address every time they post a comment.

But if you want to approve comments from a specific user automatically, then you can do it by following the below steps.

1. Open the specific post in your dashboard and click on the "Advanced Options" button.
1. You will see a button called "View Comments", click on it.
1. Then click on "Approve Email" next to the email address of the comment you want to approve.

From now on, all the comments from that user email will be automatically approved and published on your blog. You can disapprove the email anytime by clicking the "Disapprove Email" button.

1. If you use Office 365 or Outlook, or potentially other Email systems, you may notice that your Email invitation Links are not working. This is because the invitation Email your User is receiving is being scanned by the Email provider. In the specific case of Outlook and their "SafeLink" feature. You will get the error: "Unable to sign in - this link is no longer valid".
